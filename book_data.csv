Unfortunately For Beard, The Fifth Of Those Women To Marry Him Is Openly Sleeping With The Couple's Building Contractor, Rodney Tarpin. Although Beard Has Cheated On Patrice, He Now Wants Her Back And Decides To Make Her Jealous By Pretending That He Has A Female Visitor While Patrice Is In Her Bedroom.

Then He Gave Out A Muted Whoop. Patrice Should Know He Was Having Fun.

Set In Post-civil War Ohio, It Is The Story Of Sethe, An Escaped Slave Who Has Risked Her Life In Order To Wrench Herself From A Living Death; Who Has Lost A Husband And Buried A Child; Who Has Borne The Unthinkable And Not Gone Mad. Sethe, Who Now Lives In A Small House On The Edge Of Town With Her Daughter, Denver, Her Mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, And A Disturbing, Mesmerizing Apparition Who Calls Herself Beloved.<p>sethe Works At &quot;beating Back The Past,&quot; But It Makes Itself Heard And Felt Incessantly&#58; In Her Memory; In Denver's Fear Of The World Outside The House; In The Sadness That Consumes Baby Suggs; In The Arrival Of Paul D, A Fellow Former Slave; And, Most Powerfully, In Beloved, Whose Childhood Belongs To The Hideous Logic Of Slavery And Who Has Now Come From The &quot;place Over There&quot; To Claim Retribution For What She Lost And For What Was Taken From Her. Sethe's Struggle To Keep Beloved From Gaining Possession Of Her Present&#151;and To Throw Off The Long-dark Legacy Of Her Past&#151;is At The Center Of This Spellbinding Novel. But It Also Moves Beyond Its Particulars, Combining Imagination And The Vision Of Legend With The Unassailable Truths Of History.<br>upon The Original Publication Of <b>beloved</b>, John Leonard Wrote In The <i>los Angeles Times</i>&#58; &quot;i Can't Imagine American Literature Without It.&quot; In Fact, More Than A Decade Later, It Remains A Preeminent Novel Of Our Time, Speaking With Timeless Clarity And Power To Our Experience As A Nation With A Past Of Both Abominable And Ennobling Circumstance.</p><h3>sacred Life</h3><p>when Toni Morrison Was An Editor At Random House, She Edited <i>the Black Book</i>, An Anthology&#47scrapbook Of African American History. While Working On The Book, She Ran Across A Newspaper Article About A Woman Named Margaret Garner, A Runaway Slave Who Killed Her Children, Slitting The Throat Of One And Bashing In The Skull Of The Other, To Prevent Them From Being Recaptured By The Slave Hunters Hot On Their Trail. This Upside Down Story Of Motherly Love Expressed Through Child Murder Haunted Morrison For Many Years And Finally Manifest Itself In Fictional Form In Her Pulitzer Prize-winning Fifth Novel, <i>beloved</i>. A Poetic Chronicle Of Slavery And Its Aftermath, It Describes How That Inhuman Ordeal Forced Cruel Choices And Emotional Pain On Its Victims And Gave Them Memories That Would Possess Them Long After They Were Released From Their Physical Bondage. Morrison Uses The Story To Address A Key Question For Black People Then And Now: How Can We Let Go Of The Pain Of The Past And Redeem The Sacrifices Made In The Struggle For Freedom?<p> The Novel's Main Character, Sethe, Escapes From A Plantation Where She Was Viciously Abused And Perversely Cherished By Her Master For Her Skills As A Childbearer. When The Slave Hunters Come Looking For Her, She Kills Her Infant Child To Prevent Her From Becoming A Slave. After Slavery, Sethe Finds Work And Devotes Herself To Her Surviving Daughter, Denver, But Is Haunted By Memories Of Cruel Life On The Plantation She Escaped And By The Vindictive Spirit Of Her Murdered Infant, Beloved. Paul D., An Almost Supernaturally Charming Former Slave From The Same Plantation As Sethe, Arrives And Temporarily Banishes The Ghost Of The Infant Beloved. But Beloved Returns In An Older And More Dangerous Form And Sets Out To Destroy Sethe's Household By Seducing Paul D., Driving Denver Away From Her Mother, And Feeding On Sethe's Body And Spirit.<p> <i>beloved</i> Is Both Beautiful And Elusive: Beautiful For Its Powerful And Captivating Language, And Elusive Not Just Because Of Its Reliance On Visions Of Haints And Apparitions, But In Its Narrative Interweaving Of The Past And Present, The Physical And The Spiritual. For All Of Its Supernatural Elements, However, <i>beloved</i> Is Most Notable As A Powerful Tribute To The Real-life Struggles Of A Generation Of Black Men And Women To Reconcile The Horrors Of The Past And Move On. The Spirit Of Beloved And The Recurring Memories Of The Tribulations Sethe Endured On The Plantations She Lived On And Escaped From Were Both Testaments To The Tangibly Powerful Hold That Slavery Had On Her. In The End, She Is Able To Recover Her Life Only By Finding Within Herself And Her Community The Spiritual Tools Strong Enough To Exorcise Her Of This Haunting. In This, Sethe's Struggle Is The Struggle Of All African Americans: The Struggle To Redeem Ourselves, Our Families, And Our Communities From The Wreckage Of The Past Even As We Honor The Sacrifices Made For Survival.</p>",Beloved (random House Large Print),Beloved (random House Large Print)

Despite His Education And Musical And Medical Accomplishments, January Is Only A Short, Catastrophic Step Up From Bottom In The Oddly Stratified Society Of 1830s New Orleans. January Proceeds As Carefully With His Investigation As He Does With His Wooing Of Rose Vitrac, Whose Traumatic Past He Only Partially Knows And Understands. Only When Another Murder Strikes Much Closer To January's Home And Heart Does The Pace Quicken. To A Desire For Vengeance Is Added A Thirst For Justice. Still Cautious, But Steeled By Anger, January Goes On A Search That Will Lead Beyond The Fetid City Into The Surrounding Bayous, Swamps And Islands. When The Author Hits Her Stride, The Tension Ratchets Up To An Almost Unbearable Level Until The Violence Of Man And The Violence Of Nature Are Both Unleashed. Hambly Is Terrifically Effective In Her Portrayal Of The Squalid Lives Of The Poor And Enslaved And The Contrasting Opulence Of The Wealthy. The Beautiful New Orleans Of The Future Can Only Be Glimpsed In The Scrofulous, Swampy, Sewer-like Summer Heat That Pervades Everything. Hambly's Strong And Unusual Series Tracking A Largely Unexplored Period Of American History Should Continue To Please Fans And Attract New Readers.

The Ten Commandments Are Written As Eleven Sentences And Are Not Numbered So No One Tradition Is Favored. However, The Roman Catholic Interpretation Of Peter's Confession Is Used. The Gospels Are Combined To Become One Narrative Such As The Boy With The Loaves And Fishes In The Feeding Of The Five Thousand Being Followed By Christ's And Peter's Walking On The Water. The Colored Illustrations Of Samson Pulling Down The Temple And Jonah And The Giant Fish Are Truly Fearsome. Other Pictures Pick Up Interesting Details Such As The Buyers Examining Joseph's Teeth As He Is Sold Into Slavery And David With The Piece Of Saul's Cloak After Saul's Night In The Cave. The Bible Passages Are Cited Before Each Story. An Error Cites Genesis For The Story About Solomon. Although The Stories Are Factually Told, The Spirit Of The Biblical Narrative Seems Missing.

Surprisingly Some Of The Stranger And Gorier Stories Are Included Such As The Smoking Fire Pot Moving Over Animals Cut In Half, Those Who Plotted Against Daniel Being Eaten By Lions Along With Their Wives And Children Until Only Their Bones Remained, And Jael Killing Sisera With A Tent Peg. The Ten Commandments Are Written As Eleven Sentences And Are Not Numbered So No One Tradition Is Favored. However, The Roman Catholic Interpretation Of Peter's Confession Is Used. The Gospels Are Combined To Become One Narrative Such As The Boy With The Loaves And Fishes In The Feeding Of The Five Thousand Being Followed By Christ's And Peter's Walking On The Water. The Colored Illustrations Of Samson Pulling Down The Temple And Jonah And The Giant Fish Are Truly Fearsome. Other Pictures Pick Up Interesting Details Such As The Buyers Examining Joseph's Teeth As He Is Sold Into Slavery And David With The Piece Of Saul's Cloak After Saul's Night In The Cave. The Bible Passages Are Cited Before Each Story. An Error Cites Genesis For The Story About Solomon. Although The Stories Are Factually Told, The Spirit Of The Biblical Narrative Seems Missing.

The Story Opens With The Arrival Of The First Settlers, Among Them A Pragmatic English Woman, Hallie, And Her Profligate, Braggart Husband, William. Hallie Makes An Immediate And Intense Connection To The Wilderness, And The Tragic Severing Of That Connection Results In The Creation Of The Red Garden, A Small, Sorrowful Plot Of Land That Takes On An Air Of The Sacred.

The Result Is A Certain Ethereal Detachment As Hoffman's Deft Magical Realism Ties One Woman's Story To The Next Even When They Themselves Are Not Aware Of The Connection.

Each story is crafted for reading aloud, so the whole family can share the experience.<P>Accompanied by stunning full-color illustrations by Michael Welply, these timeless narratives are retold by bestselling author Mary Pope Osborne and her sister, Natalie Pope Boyce, with all the grace and wonder of the Bible itself.</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>This retelling of Bible stories is written to be read aloud. Surprisingly some of the stranger and gorier stories are included such as the smoking fire pot moving over animals cut in half, those who plotted against Daniel being eaten by lions along with their wives and children until only their bones remained, and Jael killing Sisera with a tent peg. The Ten Commandments are written as eleven sentences and are not numbered so no one tradition is favored. However, the Roman Catholic interpretation of Peter's confession is used. The Gospels are combined to become one narrative such as the boy with the loaves and fishes in the feeding of the five thousand being followed by Christ's and Peter's walking on the water. The colored illustrations of Samson pulling down the temple and Jonah and the giant fish are truly fearsome. Other pictures pick up interesting details such as the buyers examining Joseph's teeth as he is sold into slavery and David with the piece of Saul's cloak after Saul's night in the cave. The Bible passages are cited before each story. An error cites Genesis for the story about Solomon. Although the stories are factually told, the spirit of the Biblical narrative seems missing.

After He Loses The Love Of His Life To Another Man, A Despondent Martin Accepts An Offer From An Unusual Publisher To Write A Book That He Promises Will Make Martin Immortal. The Task Thrusts Him Into A Strange Web Of Long-buried Secrets, Double-crosses, And Madness. Zaf&oacute;n's Use Of Language Is Often Playful In A Borgesian Way: [the Book Cemetery] Is A Mystery. A Sanctuary. Every Book, Every Volume You See, Has A Soul. The Soul Of The Person Who Wrote It And The Soul Of Those Who Read It And Lived And Dreamed With It. Every Time A Book Changes Hands, Every Time Someone Runs His Eyes Down Its Pages, Its Spirit Grows And Strengthens. Much Of The Novel's Energy Also Derives From Martin's Sarcastic Sense Of Humor, Especially In Conversations With A Young Assistant. Ultimately, Though, The Appeal Of <em>the Angel's Game</em> Lies In Its Careful Portrait Of Martin And Its Exploration Of What It Really Means To Love Someone. Readers Who Appreciate Books, Romance, And Intrigue Will Find This Novel A Subtle, Unforgettable, And Satisfying Page-turner. --<i>jeff Vandermeer</i></p>",The Angel's Game (random House Large Print),The Angel's Game (random House Large Print)

Watching Frankie Grow Into A Talented And Confident Young Girl Has Made Grace As Happy As Any Mother Could Hope To Be. Happy Enough, Even, To Forget The Past. But The Past Never Quite Goes Away. Which Is Why A Certain Charismatic Man Also Moved To Tallanville Eight Years Ago To Watch Over Her.<p>but When Violence Threatens To Shatter Grace And Frankie's Idyllic Home, The Waiting Is Over. The Ghosts Of The Past Have Returned. And They're Hungry For Blood. Now Grace Must Resume An Identity She Thought She Had Cast Off Forever, And Match Wits With An Opponent As Deadly As He Is Cunning. The Prize&#58; An Extraordinary Secret That Only She Can Unfold. The Forfeit&#58; Losing The Thing More Precious To Her Than Life Itself.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>a Single Mom And Gifted Horse Handler, Grace Archer Goes On The Lam With Her Equally Exceptional Eight-year-old Daughter, Frankie, After A Middle Eastern Magnate Named Marvot Kills The Owner Of The Alabama Horse Farm Where They Have Been Hiding Under The Watchful Eye Of Grace's Former Employer, The Cia. Johansen (firestorm, Etc.) Blends Action, Suspense And Family Values As Frankie's Father, Ex-cia Commando Jake Kilmer, Comes Back Into Grace's Life To Protect Her And The Child He Has Never Known. Grace Blames Jake For Her Father's Death And The End Of Her Career, But There's No One Else She Trusts Against Marvot, Who Wants Her To Train His Lethal Blue-eyed Arabian Stallion And Mare, Known As The Pair, To Lead Him To Treasure Buried Somewhere In The Moroccan Desert. The Novel Starts Off With Guns Blazing And Doesn't Slow Down For Murder, Kidnapping, Blackmail, Sex Or Sandstorm. Johansen Borrows Openly From The Movies Hollywood Thinks Women Love (grace Talks To Horses, Though She Balks At Being Called A Horse Whisperer), Crafts Family Scenes (marvot Playing Chess With His Son; The Pair With Their Colt) And Offers A Mother And Father Who Defend The World From Criminals While Yearning For Domestic Tranquillity.

From The Indelible Bond That Links Him To His Father, To The Lessons Learned From His Old-fashioned Catholic Upbringing, From His Passion For The Buffalo Bills And The New York Yankees, To The Importance Of Hard Work, The Grace Of Daily Obligations, And Patriotism, Russert's Reflections Hit The Very Epicenter Of American Values. <p> Rich With Personal Anecdotes And Russert's Easygoing Style And Straight-talking Charm, <i>big Russ And Me</i> Will Be Embraced By His Myriad Fans -- And Will Delight Dads Across The Country On Father's Day And For Years To Come.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>meet The Newsman's Father In This Stupendously Entertaining Book. The Senior Tim Russert Served In Wwii, Married And Settled In South Buffalo, N.y., Worked Days For The Sanitation Department, Drove A Night Truck For The Local Evening Paper And Raised Four Kids. The Younger Russert's Memoir Begins As A Tribute To His Dad And The Lessons He Taught Through The Years, But Also Takes Ample Time To Tell How Russert Junior Grew Up And Became The Moderator Of Meet The Press. His Neighborhood In The 1950s Was Tightly Knit, Irish Catholic And Anchored By The Institutions Of Marriage, Family, Church And School. Nuns And Legionnaires Shaped Young Russert's Character; In High School, His Jesuit Instructors Strengthened And Solidified It. John Kennedy's Short Life And Career Still Resonated When Russert Began Law School In 1970. He Worked On Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1976 Campaign, Then On The Senator's Staff. A Friend Of Moynihan Provided The Link That Brought Russert To Nbc And The Today Show. He First Appeared As A Panelist On Meet The Press In 1990, Becoming Moderator In 1991. Throughout His Private And Public Life, Russert Continually Turned To His Father For Advice, And The Older Man's Common Sense Served The Younger Pretty Much Without Fail. The Memoir Is Candid And Generous, So Warm-hearted That Readers Should Forgive The Occasional Didactic Touch (and It's A Soft Touch). There Are Hard Ways To Learn Life Lessons; Fortunately, Readers Have Russert To Thank For Sharing His With Them. 16 Pages Of B&w Photos Not Seen By Pw. Agent, Bob Barnett. (may 10) Forecast: Ads In The National Press As Well As The Buffalo News, Along With Tv Satellite And Radio Drive Time Tours, And A 17-city Author Tour, Should Help Russert's Memoir To Take Off. Readers Of Tom Brokaw's Books Will Enjoy It, As Will Dads Of All Ages.

World-renowned Photographer Phoebe Dunn Captures The Interactions And Relationships That Develop Between The Children And Their Pets. Although The Photographs Seem Dated Due To The Clothing Worn By The Children Shown, Young Readers Will Nevertheless Be Able To Relate To Them. The Text Is Rather Long-winded For Reading To The Intended Age Group, And Parents Might Find Themselves Paraphrasing To Shorten Each Story. Likewise, The Early Elementary Teacher May Find The Stories To Be Too Wordy; Still, The Book Is Useful For The Pictures, Especially When Introducing A Unit About Farm Animals And Pets. Nevertheless, I Would Not Recommend This Book For The Elementary Librarian; It Would Be Better To Order A Couple Of The Individual Titles Than This Collection.

Returns With Another Novel About Family Ties, Love, Hurt And Redemption. Susannah Connolly, A Successful-on-paper Anthropology Professor, Simultaneously Loses Her Mother To Lymphoma And Ends A Long-failing Relationship With A Colleague. To Fulfill Her Mother's Last Wish, Susannah Travels To The French Camargue To Locate A Saint Linked To Her Family. Rice Picks A Grand Setting With The Camargue, But She Fails To Use The Moonlit Marshes To Create Anything More Than Overwrought Suspense. The Tale Lacks Subtlety In Its Exploration Of Local Gypsy Society, And The Author Fawns Tirelessly Over Mystical White Horses. In A Rescue Scene Straight Out Of A Fairy Tale, Susannah Meets Tall, Handsome Rancher Grey Dempsey. Grey Is Raising His Daughter, Sari, Alone-grey And Sari Were Abandoned By Sari's Mother Five Years Earlier. Despite Major Personal Issues, Grey And Susannah Fall Instantly (and Inexplicably) In Love, And From Here The Novel Grows Increasingly Lackluster. Predictably, Sari And Susannah Connect And Begin To Rediscover Themselves. Susannah Delves Further Into Her Past, Ingratiating Herself With The Vengeful And Persecuted Female Gypsy Community, Whose Most Important Saint, Sarah, Is Associated With Susannah's Birth. Sari Takes One Step Forward And Two Steps Back, Agreeing To Ride For The First Time Since Her Mother Left, Then Panicking. Ultimately Susannah Takes It Upon Herself To Find Sari's Mother So The Broken Family Can Find Closure. The Operatics Of Various Scenes (at One Point Susannah And Grey Go Scuba Diving For Cave Art, In Another They Rescue A Horse From Quicksand) And The Unrealistic Dialogue Are Tiresome.

Christian Lalanne explores every aspect of vibration and shock, two fundamental and crucially important areas of mechanical engineering, from both the theoretical and practical standpoints. As all products need to be designed to withstand the environmental conditions to which they are likely to be subjected, prototypes must be verified by calculation and laboratory tests, the latter according to specifications from national or international standards. The concept of tailoring the product to its environment has gradually developed whereby, from the very start of a design project, through the to the standards specifications and testing procedures on the prototype, the real environment in which the product being tested will be functioning is taken into account. The five volumes of Mechanical Shock and Vibration cover all the issues that need to be addressed in this area of mechanical engineering. The theoretical analyses are placed in the context of the real world and of laboratory tests - essential for the development of specifications.<br>Volume III&#58; Random Vibration The vast majority of vibrations encountered in the real environment are random in nature. Such vibrations are intrinistically complicated, and this volume describes the enabling process for simplification of the analysis required, and the analysis of the signal in the frequency domain. <br>Power spectrum density is also defined, with the requisite precautions to be taken in its calculation described togther with the processes (windowing, overlapping) necessary for improved results. <br>A further complementary method, the analysis of statistical properties of the time signal is described. This enables the distribution law of the maxima of a random Gaussian signal to be determined and simplifies calculation of fatigue damage to be made by the avoidance of the direct counting of peaks.</p>","Random Vibration, Vol. 3",random-vibration

Written using simplified language and illustrations for working professionals, pastors, teachers, students and general audiences, Random Designer establishes a whole new creation paradigm. It describes how the forces of randomness and chaos, which play central roles in our physical existence, are actually creative. The Creator simply taps these apparently random physical processes to accomplish his higher goal &#151; the creation of human beings capable of consciously perceiving and acknowledging him.<br><br><br><br>With this new awareness, we, as his ultimate creation, are free to explore the limits of our physical and spiritual potential. For the first time, we can freely consider what it means to be made in the Creator's image, to sense and acknowledge His presence and to experience a close meaningful relationship with Him. <br><br><br><br>If you have ever been told that to be a Christian you must choose between science OR faith; evolution OR creation; Biology OR the Bible, the message of Random Designer is that this is simply untrue&#58; God is in them all. Thus Random Designer invites believers and non-believers to reconsider the question of God.<br><br><br><br>Random Designer takes a more positive and constructive approach. Introducing a concept called random design, Random Designer explains many basic principles of life, then uses these insights to reveal how science and biology - including evolution &#151; are fully compatible with belief in God. <br><br><br><br>The essence of Random Design is elegantly simple&#58; No Limits! From the formation of the heavens to the development and nurture of life itself, all possibilities are automatically assembled and tested. Thus, in the most unexpected and extraordinary ways, random design endows all creation with boundless life-giving potential. The ultimate result is nothing less than spectacular - Us!<br><br><br><br>For ages, Christians have huddled in fear behind scientifically indefensible concepts of creation, like 6-day creationism and now intelligent design, quaking in the thought that science might somehow have the power to disprove God's existence. Random Designer helps show that this is not true. Science has no such power! On the other hand, God is not limited to literal interpretations of scripture, nor will He remain confined to rigid, man-made religious doctrines. His creation and revelation are ongoing. People must never be required to deny the realities of God's living world in order to be accepted into the community of Christian faith. <br><br><br><br>The truth is that the science-religion conflict is but a man-made myth&#58; There is no conflict in the mind of God. Faith and intellect really can go hand in hand&#58; They need never be at war. <br><br><br><br>If the ultimate goals of Christian apologetics are to seek out truth and to credibly keep God in the equation of life, Random Designer accomplishes this goal. By building credible bridges between science and faith, it establishes a safe harbor &#151; a place where one can freely explore and embrace the wonders of God's creation revealed by science while at the same time holding fast to faith and belief in God. Reflecting the highest intelligence, Random Designer creates a scientifically accurate conceptual framework where science is free, but just as importantly, God's place is permanently secure!<br><br><br><br>Random design seems like a paradox &#151; a contradiction of terms. But random does not mean unimportant or without design. A message of hope, purpose, and peace resonates from the apparent randomness! In fact, it has always been this way. In the midst of the most profound mysteries and apparent paradoxes, there one encounters the miraculous.<br><br> <br><br>Random Designer is a relationship quest - the story of an eternal Creator who harnesses the apparent random forces of nature for an exquisite and divine purpose &#151; to draw mankind to Himself.<br><br><br><br>Join the journey to discover the true Random Designer - God. The adventure begins with a single step of faith!<br><br></p>",Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator,random-designer

However, if characterized properly, even such randomness and the resulting uncertainty are subject to rigorous mathematical analysis. Taking into account the uniquely multidisciplinary demands of 21st-century science and engineering, Random Phenomena: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics for Engineers provides students with a working knowledge of how to solve engineering problems that involve randomly varying phenomena. Basing his approach on the principle of theoretical foundations before application, Dr. Ogunnaike presents a classroom-tested course of study that explains how to master and use probability and statistics appropriately to deal with uncertainty in standard problems and those that are new and unfamiliar. Giving students the tools and confidence to formulate practical solutions to problems, this book offers many useful features, including: Unique case studies to illustrate the fundamentals and applications of probability and foster understanding of the random variable and its distribution Examples of development, selection, and analysis of probability models for specific random variables Presentation of core concepts and ideas behind statistics and design of experiments Selected special topics, including reliability and life testing, quality assurance and control, and multivariate analysis As classic scientific boundaries continue to be restructured, the use of engineering is spilling over into more non-traditional areas, ranging from molecular biology to finance. This book emphasizes fundamentals and a first principles approach to deal with this evolution. It illustrates theory with practical examples and case studies, equipping readers to deal with a wide range of problems beyond those in the book. About the Author: Professor Ogunnaike is Interim Dean of Engineering at the University of Delaware. He is the recipient of the 2008 American Automatic Control Council's Control Engineering Practice Award, the ISA's Donald P. Eckman Education Award, the Slocomb Excellence in Teaching Award, and was elected into the US National Academy of Engineering in 2012.",Random Phenomena,Random Phenomena

We just said we were going to publish a few books on the side at random. Let&#8217;s call it Random House.&#8221; So recounts Bennett Cerf in this wonderfully amusing memoir of the making of a great publishing house. An incomparable raconteur, possessed of an irrepressible wit and an abiding love of books and authors, Cerf brilliantly evokes the heady days of Random House&#8217;s first decades. <P>Part of the vanguard of young New York publishers who revolutionized the book business in the 1920s and &#8217;30s, Cerf helped usher in publishing&#8217;s golden age. Cerf was a true personality, whose other pursuits (columnist, anthologist, author, lecturer, radio host, collector of jokes and anecdotes, perennial judge of the Miss America pageant, and panelist on <i>What&#8217;s My Line?</i>) helped shape his reputation as a man of boundless energy and enthusiasm and brought unprecedented attention to his company and to his authors. At once a rare behind-the-scenes account of book publishing and a fascinating portrait of four decades&#8217; worth of legendary authors, from James Joyce and William Faulkner to Ralph Ellison and Eudora Welty, <i>At Random</i> is a feast for bibliophiles and anyone who&#8217;s ever wondered what goes on inside a publishing house.</p>",At Random: The Reminiscences of Bennett Cerf,at-random

However, if characterized properly, even such randomness and the resulting uncertainty are subject to rigorous mathematical analysis. Taking into account the uniquely multidisciplinary demands of 21st-century science and engineering, Random Phenomena: Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics for Engineers provides students with a working knowledge of how to solve engineering problems that involve randomly varying phenomena. Basing his approach on the principle of theoretical foundations before application, Dr. Ogunnaike presents a classroom-tested course of study that explains how to master and use probability and statistics appropriately to deal with uncertainty in standard problems and those that are new and unfamiliar. Giving students the tools and confidence to formulate practical solutions to problems, this book offers many useful features, including: Unique case studies to illustrate the fundamentals and applications of probability and foster understanding of the random variable and its distribution Examples of development, selection, and analysis of probability models for specific random variables Presentation of core concepts and ideas behind statistics and design of experiments Selected special topics, including reliability and life testing, quality assurance and control, and multivariate analysis As classic scientific boundaries continue to be restructured, the use of engineering is spilling over into more non-traditional areas, ranging from molecular biology to finance. This book emphasizes fundamentals and a first principles approach to deal with this evolution. It illustrates theory with practical examples and case studies, equipping readers to deal with a wide range of problems beyond those in the book. About the Author: Professor Ogunnaike is Interim Dean of Engineering at the University of Delaware. He is the recipient of the 2008 American Automatic Control Council's Control Engineering Practice Award, the ISA's Donald P. Eckman Education Award, the Slocomb Excellence in Teaching Award, and was elected into the US National Academy of Engineering in 2012.",Random Phenomena,Random Phenomena

To Remedy This, He Formed The Idea Of Journeying About His House From Room To Room To &ldquo;write A History Of The World Without Leaving Home.&rdquo; The Bathroom Provides The Occasion For A History Of Hygiene; The Bedroom, Sex, Death, And Sleep; The Kitchen, Nutrition And The Spice Trade; And So On, As Bryson Shows How Each Has Fig&shy;ured In The Evolution Of Private Life. Whatever Happens In The World, He Demonstrates, Ends Up In Our House, In The Paint And The Pipes And The Pillows And Every Item Of Furniture. <p>bill Bryson Has One Of The Liveliest, Most Inquisitive Minds On The Planet, And He Is A Master At Turning The Seemingly Isolated Or Mundane Fact Into An Occasion For The Most Diverting Exposi&shy;tion Imaginable.

And That, I Am Happy To Say, Is Easy Enough, For Bryson Really Is A Virtuoso Of Deft Sketches Of The Enormous, Mostly Unintended, Consequences Of Alterations In Material Life. In Addition His Wit Is As Engaging As Ever, And His Appreciation Of Human Foible And Earnest Nonsense -- From Thomas Edison's Concrete Piano To The Mystery Of Fish Knives -- Remains Undimmed.</p> </p>",At Home: A Short History Of Private Life (random House Large Print),At Home: A Short History Of Private Life (random House Large Print)

Giving Is An Inspiring Look At How Each Of Us Can Change The World. First, It Reveals The Extraordinary And Innovative Efforts Now Being Made By Companies And Organizations And By Individuals To Solve Problems And Save Lives Both Down The Street And Around The World. Then It Urges Us To Seek Out What Each Of Us, Regardless Of Income, Available Time, Age, And Skills, Can Do To Help, To Give People A Chance To Live Out Their Dreams. Bill Clinton Shares His Own Experiences And Those Of Other Givers, Representing A Global Flood Tide Of Nongovernmental, Nonprofit Activity. These Remarkable Stories Demonstrate That Gifts Of Time, Skills, Things, And Ideas Are As Important And Effective As Contributions Of Money.<p>from Bill And Melinda Gates To A Six-year-old California Girl Named Mckenzie Steiner, Who Organized And Supervised Drives To Clean Up The Beach In Her Community, Clinton...</p> <h3>kirkus Reviews</h3> <p>the Former President Provides Dozens Of Effective And Communicable Examples Of Giving. I Wrote This Book To Encourage You To Give Whatever You Can, Because Everyone Can Give Something. And There's So Much To Be Done, Down The Street And Around The World, He Writes. For Clinton (my Life, 2004), Giving Is The Right Thing To Do; Acts Of Unfettered Goodwill Promote Harmony And Trust. Writing In An Unhurried Style, The Author Doesn't Chide Or Prod The Reader, But Simply Provides Numerous Examples Of Giving Of All Kinds, Whether It Be A Multimillion-dollar Gift Or The Simple Donation Of An Old, Unused Saxophone To A School Music Program. Bill Gates, Bono And Tiger Woods May Grab The Headlines, But Clinton Is Especially Concerned With The Giver Of Modest Gifts Or What Little Spare Time They Have. To That Effect, Clinton Quotes Warren Buffett, Who Recently Gave $30 Billion To The Gates Foundation: My Gift Is Nothing . . . .the People I Really Admire Are The Small Donors Who Give Up A Movie Or A Restaurant Meal To Help Needier People. Clinton Inspires By Pointing The Way And Introducing A Company Of Givers. If You Know How To Tie A Fishing Fly, Teach Someone Else. If You're Appalled By The Trash On The Sidewalk Or Your Local Beach, Pick It Up-or, Better, Organize A Sustaining Drive To Keep The Area Clean. If You Own A Business, Consider Hiring Someone On Welfare Or With A Disability. Also, Says Clinton, Think About Injecting Your Giving With A Dash Of Humor-down In His Home State, There's An Annual Raccoon Supper To Equip The Local Football Team; Clinton Advises Using Plenty Of Barbecue Sauce On The Meat. He Goes On To Suggest Participation In Something As Profound As Seeds Of Peace, Whichbrings Together Young People Of Different Religious And Ethnic Groups Long At Odds With One Another.

This book presents an elementary and systematic introduction to modeling of between-cluster variation, how results are best interpreted, and computational methods for estimation. The book addresses many important issues in the social sciences that can be best described in terms of variation sources and patterns, such as temporal, between-person, and geographical variation. By providing a balanced presentation of the advantages and limitations of these methods, the author has provided an introduction to the subject that will be of great utility to statisticians and students concentrating on social science data analysis.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Many important issues in the social sciences can be formulated in terms of sources of variation, such as temporal, between-person (natural), or geographical variation, and of their patterns.

Since the emphasis is on practice in relation to the theoretical background of uniform random numbers, the discussion of interesting, but rather philosophical questions concerning randomness itself is limited to some appropriate references.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Reviews advances during the past decade in generating truly unpredictable random numbers on a computer, which is useful for modeling discrete events, VLSI testing, cryptology, and financial engineering as well as computer games.

The development carefully provides the basic definitions of mutual intersection and self-intersection local times for Brownian motions and the accompanying large deviation results. The book then proceeds to the analogues of these concepts and results for random walks on lattices of $R^d$. This includes suitable integrability and large deviation results for these models and some applications. Moreover, the notes and comments at the end of the chapters provide interesting remarks and references to various related results, as well as a good number of exercises.

We sometimes choose between options at random, and if we toss a coin we know it will land heads or tails at random. But are events like these truly random? Randomness turns out to be one of those concepts, like solid matter in physics, that works just fine on an everyday level but mysteriously disappears once we move in to examine its fine structure. In this fascinating book, mathematician Ed Beltrami takes a close enough look at randomness to make it mysteriously disappear. The results of coin tosses, it turns out, are determined from the start, and only our incomplete knowledge makes them look random. Random sequences of numbers are more elusive&#151;they may be truly random, but Godel's undecidability theorem informs us that we'll never know. Their apparent randomness may be only a shortcoming of our minds. Mathematicians have even discovered a string of numbers that appears random&#151;but when you reverse the string, it's completely deterministic! People familiar with quantum indeterminacy tell us that order is an illusion, and that the world is fundamentally random. Yet randomness is also an illusion. Then which is real? Perhaps order and randomness, like waves and particles, are only two sides of the same coin.</p>",What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life,what-is-random

Computer scientists need random generators for performance analysis, simulation, image synthesis, etc. In this context random generation of trees is of particular interest. The algorithms presented here are efficient and easy to code. Some aspects of Horton&#151;Strahler numbers, programs written in C and pictures are presented in the appendices. The complexity analysis is done rigorously both in the worst and average cases. <br> Random Generation of Trees is intended for students in computer science and applied mathematics as well as researchers interested in random generation.</p> <h3>Booknews</h3> <p>Johnny Appleseed would find little here to help his life work, but if he wanted to explore a frontier linking computer science, combinatorics, and probability theory, he could learn how to generate random patterns for such tasks as performance analysis, simulation, and image synthesis. Efficient algorithms that are usually easy to code, some aspects of Horton-Strahler numbers written in C, and pictures of trees generated by computers are among the information provided. Some sections are didactic for beginners and others highly technical for veterans. Annotation c.

This work suggests that this not need to be so. In an informal presentation, instead, the problem is traced to traditional assumptions regarding dynamical equations and their need for unique solutions. If this requirement is relaxed, the equations admit for instability and stochasticity evolving from the dynamics itself. This allows for a decoupling from the &ldquo;burden&rdquo; of the past and provides insights into concepts such as predictability, irreversibility, adaptability, creativity and multi-choice behaviour. This reformulation is especially relevant for biological and social sciences whose need for flexibility a propos of environmental demands is important to understand&#58; this suggests that many system models are based on randomness and nondeterminism complicated with a little bit of determinism to ultimately achieve concurrent flexibility and stability. As a result, the statistical perception of reality is seen as being a more productive tool than classical determinism. The book addresses scientists of all disciplines, with special emphasis at making the ideas more accessible to scientists and students not traditionally involved in the formal mathematics of the physical sciences. The implications may be of interest also to specialists in the philosophy of science.<P>&middot;Presents the ideas in an informal language.<br>&middot;Provides tools for exploring data for singularities.</p>",Unstable Singular Random H,unstable-singular-random-h

Both general-purpose approaches, which can be used to generate samples from arbitrary probability distributions, and tailored techniques, designed to efficiently address common real-world practical problems, are introduced and discussed in detail. In turn, the monograph presents fundamental results and methodologies in the field, elaborating and developing them into the latest techniques. The theory and methods are illustrated with a varied collection of examples, which are discussed in detail in the text and supplemented with ready-to-run computer code. The main problem addressed in the book is how to generate independent random samples from an arbitrary probability distribution with the weakest possible constraints or assumptions in a form suitable for practical implementation. The authors review the fundamental results and methods in the field, address the latest methods, and emphasize the links and interplay between ostensibly diverse techniques.",Independent Random Sampling Methods,Independent Random Sampling Methods

First proposed in the late 60&#8217;s, random lasers have grown to a large research field. This book reviews the history and the state of the art of random lasers, provides an outline of the basic models describing their behavior, and describes the recent advances in the field. The major focus of the book is on solid-state random lasers. However, it also briefly describes random lasers based on liquid dyes with scatterers. The chapters of the book are almost independent of each other. So, the scientists or engineers interested in any particular aspect of random lasers can read directly the relevant section. Researchers entering the field of random lasers will find in the book an overview of the field of study. Scientists working in the field can use the book as a reference source.</p>",Solid-State Random Lasers,solid-state-random-lasers

Social Scientists Routinely Conduct Empirical Work With Data And Modelling Assumptions That Reveal A Set To Which The Parameter Of Interest Belongs, But Not Its Exact Value. Random Set Theory Provides A Coherent Mathematical Framework To Conduct Identification Analysis And Statistical Inference In This Setting And Has Become A Fundamental Tool In Econometrics And Finance. This Is The First Book Dedicated To The Use Of The Theory In Econometrics, Written To Be Accessible For Readers Without A Background In Pure Mathematics. Molchanov And Molinari Define The Basics Of The Theory And Illustrate The Mathematical Concepts By Their Application In The Analysis Of Econometric Models. The Book Includes Sets Of Exercises To Accompany Each Chapter As Well As Examples To Help Readers Apply The Theory Effectively. 1. Basic Concepts Of Random Sets -- Random Closed Sets -- Hitting Probabilities And The Capacity Functional -- Other Functionals Generated By Random Sets -- Capacities In Game Theory And Economics -- 2.

Their Tales Offer The Book's Most Entertaining Moments: Phlegmatic Jack, Who's Conversational `off' Button Got Jammed, Likes To Sing Old Songs, While Gregarious Marge Likes To Drink And Repeatedly Spices Her Conversation With Profanity (toora Loora, My Ass! She Yells During One Of Jack's Songs). Although Marge's Behavior Begins To Seem More Unnerving Than Unusual, Leonard's Account Of Her Brave Childhood With An Abusive Father Is The Book's Highlight. But Leonard Keeps Putting Himself At The Center Of The Story, Detailing How Charmed His Life Has Been From His College Prep High School Days To Lucking Into His Tv Career, Which Makes For Dull Reading.

Although its predecessors such as geometric probability date back to the 18th century, the formal concept of a random set was developed in the beginning of the 1970s. Theory of Random Sets presents a state of the art treatment of the modern theory, but it does not neglect to recall and build on the foundations laid by Matheron and others, including the vast advances in stochastic geometry, probability theory, set-valued analysis, and statistical inference of the 1990s.<p>The book is entirely self-contained, systematic and exhaustive, with the full proofs that are necessary to gain insight. It shows the various interdisciplinary relationships of random set theory within other parts of mathematics, and at the same time, fixes terminology and notation that are often varying in the current literature to establish it as a natural part of modern probability theory, and to provide a platform for future development. An extensive, searchable bibliography to accompany the book is freely available via the web.<p>The book will be an invaluable reference for probabilists, mathematicians in convex and integral geometry, set-valued analysis, capacity and potential theory, mathematical statisticians in spatial statistics and image analysis, specialists in mathematical economics, and electronic and electrical engineers interested in image analysis.</p>",Theory of Random Sets,theory-of-random-sets

Taken as a whole, the project undertaken in the book is to establish optimality or near-optimality for Markovian policies in the control of spatiotemporal Markovian processes. The authors apply this general principle to different frameworks of Markovian systems and processes. Depending on the structure of the systems and the surroundings of the model classes the authors arrive at different levels of simplicity for the policy classes which encompass optimal or nearly optimal policies. A set of examples accompanies the theoretical findings, and these examples should demonstrate some important application areas for the theorems discussed.</p>",Control of Spatially Structured Random Processes and Random Fields with Applications,control-of-spatially-structured-random-processes-and-random-fields-with-applications

Random vibration is one of the main design drivers in the context of the design, development and verification of spacecraft structures, instruments, equipment, etc, and Miles’ equation provides a valuable tool for solving random vibration problems. It allows mechanical engineers to make rapid preliminary random response predictions when the (complex) structure is exposed to mechanical and acoustical loads.

Even though the perspectives range from very different fields of mathematics, they all contribute with important results to the same wonderful topic from structure theory, which, by extending a quotation of Laurent Saloff-Coste, could be described by 'exploration of groups by random processes'.","Random Walks, Boundaries and Spectra","Random Walks, Boundaries and Spectra"

Roderick is the boisterous and unprincipled hero who answers life's many misfortunes with a sledgehammer. Left penniless, he leaves his native Scotland for London and on the way meets Strap, and old schoolfellow. Together they undergo many adventures at the hands of scoundrels and rogues. Roderick qualifies as a surgeon's mate and is pressed as a common soldier on board the man-of-war Thunder. In a tale of romance as well as adventure, Roderick also finds time to fall in love... Smollett drew on his own experiences as a surgeon's mate in the navy for the memorable scenes on board ship, and the novel combines documentary realism with great humor and panache.</p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p>Gr 8 Up-Trollope's tale about Lily Dale, and her love for the calculating Adolphus Crosbie.</p>",The Adventures of Roderick Random,the-adventures-of-roderick-random

Although this theory plays a fundamental role in most areas of modern probability, much of it, including the most basic material, has previously been available only in scores of journal articles.

This book presents and discusses common methods of generating random graphs. It begins with approaches such as Exponential Random Graph Models, where the targeted probability of each network appearing in the ensemble is specified. This section also includes degree-preserving randomisation algorithms, where the aim is to generate networks with the correct number of links at each node, and care must be taken to avoid introducing a bias. Separately, it looks at growth style algorithms (e.g. preferential attachment) which aim to model a real process and then to analyse the resulting ensemble of graphs. It also covers how to generate special types of graphs including modular graphs, graphs with community structure and temporal graphs. The book is aimed at the graduate student or advanced undergraduate. It includes many worked examples and open questions making it suitable for use in teaching. Explicit pseudocode algorithms are included throughout the book to make the ideas straightforward to apply. With larger and larger datasets, it is crucial to have practical and well-understood tools. Being able to test a hypothesis against a properly specified control case is at the heart of the 'scientific method'. Hence, knowledge on how to generate controlled and unbiased random graph ensembles is vital for anybody wishing to apply network science in their research.",Generating Random Networks and Graphs,Generating Random Networks and Graphs

Even when Ben tickles its belly, does a dizzy dance, and sticks out his tongue, Penguin makes no response. What will it take for Penguin to say something &mdash; or for Ben to understand what Penguin has to say? Spare illustrations bring whimsy to this offbeat tale, in which a little boy gets his heart&rsquo;s desire.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Dunbar's (<I>Flyaway Katie</I>) winsome mixed media illustrations carry the day in a story that pulls a few punches on readers. From the striking white cover illustrations of Penguin with the title displayed in textured primary colors, to the blue Sendak-like lion that precipitates the denouement, the illustrations are child-centered, deceptively simple, and satisfying. No matter what Ben does, his new penguin won't respond. The white background focuses attention on the characters, while Dunbar's use of line is particularly effective in showing Ben's mixed emotions. The abrupt resolution of Ben's problem, however, while creative, could be problematic. When a passing Lion swallows the frustrated toddler for noisily shouting, SAY SOMETHING! Penguin bites Lion's nose. Ben is instantly burped up, and finally, Penguin [says] everything. But Penguin's way of saying everything is to use pictures; these are contained in a huge speech bubble. Because the book initially seems to present a real boy and his stuffed toy, Lion's appearance seems surprising, as if a phoenix emerged in the middle of a pioneer diary. This change in the construction of the reality of the story may be baffling or intriguing depending on the reader, but nearly everyone will enjoy retracing and comparing the narrator's story told in words with Penguin's story told in pictures.

It Was One That Led Him Steadily To A Fresh Interpretation Of Human Interaction With God&#151;as Born Solely From God's Grace And Not The Church's Mediation&#151;and To The Famous Theses He Posted At Wittenberg In 1517. <p> Luther's Persistence In This Belief, And In His Long Battle With Church Leaders&#151;embellished By Rich Historical Background&#151;make Marty's Biography Riveting Reading. Luther's Obdurate Yet Receptive Stance, So Different From The Travestied Image Of &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo; We Currently Face, Restored The Balance Between Religion And The Individual. <i>martin Luther</i> Is At Once A Fascinating History, A Story Of Immense Spiritual Passion And Amazing Grace, And A Superb Intellectual Biography.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>marty, Professor Emeritus At The University Of Chicago And Winner Of The National Book Award For Righteous Empire, Offers A Sterling Biography Of History's Irascible Reformer. In Concise, Accessible Style, Marty Outlines Luther's Life And Times, Gauging Why This Man Changed The Face Of Europe And Western Christianity. Marty Excels In Distilling Debates That Were Matters Of Life And Death 500 Years Ago But Seem Obscure To Christians Today. Although The Celibacy Of The Clergy Is A Controversy That No Contemporary Reader Will Need Explained, Other Issues Such As Infant Baptism, Communion In Both Kinds (the Laity Receiving Both The Bread And The Wine) And Justification By Grace Through Faith Are Made Accessible By Marty's Skillful Narration. He Depicts Luther As A Man Of Extremes, Bound Up In Contradictions. Marty Wryly Notes That Luther's Biographer Is Doomed To Qualify Any Statement About Him With The Phrase At The Same Time. The Theologian Was Tender, Yet At The Same Time Blustery And Arrogant; He Could Be A Superbly Cogent Thinker, Yet Near The End Of His Life He Published A Horrific Attack On Jews That Unthinkingly Drew Upon Traditional Christian Rumors And Whispered Claims About Alleged Jewish Atrocities. Even His Beliefs Seemed Rife With Contradiction: Christians Were Simultaneously Justified And Sinners; They Were Perfectly Free But Bound In Service To All; God Was Both Revealed And Inscrutable. Marty Is Sensitive To Luther's Deep, Lifelong Quest For Theological Assurance And His Struggles With Doubt. This Is The Best Brief Biography Of Luther Ever Penned.

First Published In 1923 And Told Through A Series Of Vignettes, Cane Uses Poetry, Prose, And Play-like Dialogue To Create A Window Into The Varied Lives Of African Americans Living In The Rural South And Urban North During A Time When Jim Crow Laws Pervaded And Racism Reigned. While Critically Acclaimed And Known Today As A Pioneering Text Of The Harlem Renaissance, The Book Did Not Gain As Much Popularity As Other Works Written During The Period. Fellow Harlem Renaissance Writer Langston Hughes Believed Cane's Lack Of A Wider Readership Was Because It Didn't Reinforce The Stereotypes Often Associated With African Americans During The Time, But Portrayed Them In An Accurate And Entirely Human Way, Breaking The Mold And Laying The Groundwork For How African Americans Are Depicted In Literature.

It Is A Quintessential Tale Of Suspense And Horror, Boasting One Of The Most Terrifying Characters Ever Born In Literature&#58; Count Dracula, A Tragic, Night-dwelling Specter Who Feeds Upon The Blood Of The Living, And Whose Diabolical Passions Prey Upon The Innocent, The Helpless, And The Beautiful. But <i>dracula</i> Also Stands As A Bleak Allegorical Saga Of An Eternally Cursed Being Whose Nocturnal Atrocities Reflect The Dark Underside Of The Supremely Moralistic Age In Which It Was Originally Written &#151; And The Corrupt Desires That Continue To Plague The Modern Human Condition.</p><h3>1897 London Times Review Monday August 23rd</h3><p>dracula Cannot Be Described As A Domestic Novel, Nor Its Annals As Those Of A Quiet Life. The Circumstances Described Are From The First Peculiar. A Young Solicitor Sent For On Business By A Client In Transylvania Goes Through Some Unusual Experiences. He Finds Himself Shut Up In A Half Ruined Castle With A Host Who Is Only Seen At Night And Three Beautiful Females Who Have The Misfortune Of Being Vampires. Their Intentions, Which Can Hardly Be Described As Honourable, Are To Suck His Blood, In Order To Sustain Their Own Vitality. Count Dracula (the Host) Is Also A Vampire But Has Grown Tired Of His Compatriots, However Young And Beautiful, And Has A Great Desire For What May Literally Be Called Fresh Blood. He Has Therefore Sent For The Solicitor That Through His Means He May Be Introduced To London Society. Without Understanding The Count's Views, Mr. Harker Has Good Reason For Having Suspicions Of His Client. Wolves Come At His Command, And Also Fogs; He Is Also Too Clever By Half At Climbing. There Is A Splendid Prospect From The Castle Terrace, Which Mr. Harker Would Have Enjoyed But For His Conviction That He Would Never Leave The Place Alive-<br>. . .<br> These Scenes And Situations, Striking As They Are, Become Commonplace Compared With Count Dracula's Goings On In London. As Falstaff Was Not Only Witty Himself But The Cause Of Wit In Other People, So A Vampire, It Seems, Compels Those It Has Bitten (two Little Marks On The Throat Are Its Token, Usually Taken By Faculty For The Scratches Of A Broach) To Become After Death Vampires Also. Nothing Can Keep Them Away But Garlic, Which Is, Perhaps, Why That Comestible Is So Popular In Certain Countries. One May Imagine, Therefore,how The Thing Spread In London After The Count's Arrival. The Only Chance Of Stopping It Was To Kill The Count Before Any Of His Victims Died, And This Was A Difficult Job, For Though Several Centuries Old, He Was Very Young And Strong, And Could Become A Dog Or A Bat At Pleasure. However, It Is Undertaken By Four Resolute And High-principled Persons, And How It Is Managed Forms The Subject Of The Story, Of Which Nobody Can Complain That It Is Deficient In Dramatic Situations. We Would Not However, Recommend It To Nervous Persons For Evening Reading.</p>",Dracula (penguin Classics),Dracula (penguin Classics)

B. Lewis, Elizabeth Cody Kimmel's hilarious romp through the land of be-careful-what-you-wish-for offers a whole year's worth of holiday fun magic.</b><P>This year, I was very specific in my letter to Santa Claus.<P>Each year at Christmas, Joe writes a letter to Santa. But they've had a few misunderstandings in the past. Last year, for example, Joe wanted a fire-engine-red racecar with retracting headlights, and he did get one &#8212; but it was only three inches long. So this year Joe is really, really careful. He describes exactly what he wants &#8212; and on Christmas morning, guess what's waiting for him under the tree! Santa has brought him a living, breathing, black-and-white penguin named Osbert. Will anything in Joe's life ever be the same?</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this playful cautionary tale, a boy asks Santa for-and receives-a gift that proves more than he can handle. On Christmas morning, Joe tiptoes downstairs to find just what he wanted under the tree: a real-live penguin named Osbert. But after several very frigid days out in the snow, lots of cold-water baths and meals of creamed herring with his new penguin pal, Joe wonders if he's made a wise choice. A follow-up letter to Santa gets a response with some thinly veiled advice in the form of two free passes to the grand opening of Antarctic World at the local zoo. Though the predictable ending wraps things up tidily, youngsters will still find much to enjoy in this lighthearted fantasy with realistic holiday roots (and the refrain will likely produce chuckles: But I had asked for Osbert, and now I had him). Lewis's (Can I Have a Stegosaurus, Mom? Can I? Please!?) blend of watercolor, pastel and some digital rendering creates an appropriately dreamy-looking backdrop for Joe's adventure. A cool blue-white palette is often tempered with the glow and shadow generated by inviting indoor lighting. Ages 4-8. (Oct.)

Knight In Penguin Classics. In 1818, When He Was In His Mid-thirties, Stendhal Met And Fell Passionately In Love With The Beautiful Mathilde Dembowski. She, However, Was Quick To Make It Clear That She Did Not Return His Affections, And In His Despair He Turned To The Written Word To Exorcise His Love And Explain His Feelings. The Result Is An Intensely Personal Dissection Of The Process Of Falling - And Being - In Love: A Unique Blend Of Poetry, Anecdote, Philosophy, Psychology And Social Observation. Bringing Together The Conflicting Sides Of His Nature, The Deeply Emotional And The Coolly Analytical, Stendhal Created A Work That Is Both Acutely Personal And Universally Applicable. This Translation Retains All The Colour And Passion Of The Original And Is Accompanied Buy The Author's Original Prefaces And Appendices. In Their Introduction, Jean Stewart And B.c.j.g. Knight Discuss The Relationship Between Stendhal And His Beloved And Explore His Views On Feminism, Education And Society. Stendhal (1783-1842) Was The Pseudonym Of Henri Marie Beyle, Born And Raised In Grenoble. Offered A Post In The Ministry Of War, From 1800 Onwards He Followed Napoleon's Campaigns Throughout Europe Before Retiring To Italy. Here, As 'stendhal', He Began Writing On Art, Music And Travel. Though Not Well-received During His Lifetime, His Work, Including The Red And The Black (1830) And The Charterhouse Of Parma (1839), Now Places Him Among The Pioneers Of Nineteenth-century Literary Realism.

His 'concept Script' Overthrew Aristotle's Long-established System Of Logic And Underlies All Subsequent Developments In The Subject. His Radically New Approach To The Foundations Of Arithmetic, Based On Fresh Definitions Of The Terms 'zero', 'one' And 'successor', Revolutionized Our Understanding Of Mathematics. And His Important Insights Into The Nature Of Language And Meaning Provided The Framework For Russell, Wittgenstein And Twentieth-century Linguistic Analysis. In This Superb Survey Of His Evolving Ideas, Anthony Kenny Explains And Assesses The Full Range Of Frege's Work And Reveals Why It Still Forms An Ideal Introduction To Modern Analytic Philosophy.

Stendhal's obsession with Mathilde Viscontini Dembowski is at the heart of this book. For her part, she neither returned his love nor understood him. In an attempt to explain his feelings to her--and to exorcize his love--he dissects his passion.

She is convinced there is something more out there. So she sets out on a quest&#151;a quest for color. When she finally finds what she's been looking for, it's everything she hoped for and more. But that doesn't mean she will ever stop looking.</p><h3>The Barnes & Noble Review</h3><p>Antoinette Portis's first picture book, <em>Not a Box,</em> was a stunning exploration of the imaginative world of early childhood. With a deft hand for sophisticated simplicity, Portis does it again with a graphic examination of the way color is central to our lives. The main character is Edna, a penguin. Edna, a torpedo-shaped form, bisected in black and white, placidly observes the colors that surround her. &nbsp;'White,' thinks Edna. As we join her gazing across an expanse of snow that reaches to the horizon a narrow band just inches from the top of the page. Short brushstrokes of white are tapped across the surface, indicating falling snow. The snowflakes subtly change shades, white on the gray sky transforming to a light gray and drifting to join the snow on the ground. Edna yearns for more colors as she observes the black of the night, then the blue of the sea and sky. She ventures forth on her quest for a hue that is not white, not black, and not blue. After a long expedition, she literally falls into a hill of safety orange. Edna embraces the glaring color and runs home as fast as she can to share her discovery. The community of penguins, following her lead, immediately begin the arduous journey over the frozen landscape. They finally arrive at the vivid arc of color that is the orange-clad Antarctic scientists' tent. Portis combines clean line with a limited palette, a very few words, and a deadpan sense of humor to create a surprisingly affecting tale of the quest for a world beyond our everyday experience. --<i>Lisa Von Drasek</i></p>",A Penguin Story,a-penguin-story

B. Lewis, Elizabeth Cody Kimmel's hilarious romp through the land of be-careful-what-you-wish-for offers a whole year's worth of holiday fun magic.</b><P>This year, I was very specific in my letter to Santa Claus.<P>Each year at Christmas, Joe writes a letter to Santa. But they've had a few misunderstandings in the past. Last year, for example, Joe wanted a fire-engine-red racecar with retracting headlights, and he did get one &#8212; but it was only three inches long. So this year Joe is really, really careful. He describes exactly what he wants &#8212; and on Christmas morning, guess what's waiting for him under the tree! Santa has brought him a living, breathing, black-and-white penguin named Osbert. Will anything in Joe's life ever be the same?</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In this playful cautionary tale, a boy asks Santa for-and receives-a gift that proves more than he can handle. On Christmas morning, Joe tiptoes downstairs to find just what he wanted under the tree: a real-live penguin named Osbert. But after several very frigid days out in the snow, lots of cold-water baths and meals of creamed herring with his new penguin pal, Joe wonders if he's made a wise choice. A follow-up letter to Santa gets a response with some thinly veiled advice in the form of two free passes to the grand opening of Antarctic World at the local zoo. Though the predictable ending wraps things up tidily, youngsters will still find much to enjoy in this lighthearted fantasy with realistic holiday roots (and the refrain will likely produce chuckles: But I had asked for Osbert, and now I had him). Lewis's (Can I Have a Stegosaurus, Mom? Can I? Please!?) blend of watercolor, pastel and some digital rendering creates an appropriately dreamy-looking backdrop for Joe's adventure. A cool blue-white palette is often tempered with the glow and shadow generated by inviting indoor lighting. Ages 4-8. (Oct.)

This autobiography reveals the emotional intensity with which Augustine lives his life. Discover how he obtained his spiritual growth and unshakable faith.</p><h3>Library Journal</h3><p>The latest volume in the series Augustine for the Twenty-First Century, which will offer the first complete translation of all of Augustine's works into English, adds yet another vision of the Confessions to the many already available. The fourth-century bishop of Hippo in North Africa wrote this extended prayer, the first true autobiography, to confess his sins and God's goodness. It has been a standard of spiritual literature ever since. Boulding (Marked for Life, Abingdon, 1996), a Benedictine nun of Stanbrook Abbey, England, offers us a fine, smooth translation that is a pleasure to read. Hers is also the first English translation to use inclusive language. There is a complete index, which greatly enhances the usefulness of this particular volume. For all readers.Augustine J.

A Political Correspondent For The New York Times For More Than Thirty Years, Wicker Was A First-hand Witness To And Reporter Of George H. W. Bush&rsquo;s Political Rise And Presidential Reign. In George Herbert Walker Bush, Wicker Provides A Richly Drawn And Succinct Overview Of Bush From His New England Roots, His Decorated Service In World War Ii, And His Successful Oil Businesses To His Shift To Politics And Rapid Rise Within The Republican Party. As He Describes Changes Within The Republican Party In Recent Decades, Wicker Charts Bush&rsquo;s Career, Including In-depth Analysis Of His Campaign Tactics And His Gift For Creating Friendships And Inspiring Loyalty Which, Wicker Argues, Has Been The Key To Bush&rsquo;s Success. The Result Is A Fascinating, Timely Glimpse Into One Of The Most Powerful Families In America Today, Complete With Insights Into The Current Reign Of George W. Bush, The Continued Legacy Of The Bush Family, And Contemporary American Politics.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>the Opening Anecdote Sets The Tone For This Uncomplimentary Brief Bio: Wicker Recounts A Visit By An (unnamed) Friend To The Post-presidential Office Of George H.w. Bush In Houston. The Two Men Share An Hour Of Purposeless Small Talk, Prompting The Friend And The Author To Reflect That The Visit Is A Microcosm Of The Life Of Bush, Who Seemed To Have No Strong Purpose Other Than A Burning Desire To Become President. The Rest Of Wicker's Biography Sketches Bush As A Man With The Faults And Virtues Of His Patrician Background: Loyalty, Gregariousness, Personal Modesty, Intense Competitiveness, A Shallow Mind And A Deep Sense Of Entitlement. His Credentials For The White House, Wicker Notes, Were Scanty; The Author Dismisses Bush's Impressive-looking R Sum (two-term Congressman, U.n. Ambassador, Cia Director, Gop Chairman, Reagan's Vice-president) As Padded With Thankless Jobs Proffered By Presidents Who Found Him Harmless And Pliable. He Credits Bush With Two Impressive Acts: Daring To Recommend Resignation To President Nixon (before The Entire Cabinet, No Less) At The Climax Of The Watergate Scandal And Forging The Global Coalition That Drove The Armies Of Saddam Hussein From Kuwait In 1991 A Feat Of Diplomacy, Wicker Notes, Made Possible By Bush's Lifelong Skill At Befriending Practically Everyone. But Veteran Journalist Wicker Faults Bush For What The Author Categorizes As A Readiness To Alter Positions For Political Advantage And Repeated Use Of Low Blows To Attack Electoral Opponents Like Bob Dole And Michael Dukakis (behavior That, He Claims, Bush Would Never Have Tolerated On The Tennis Court). For Those Who Lived Through The Bush Years, The Story Wicker Tells Is A Familiar One, Here Usefully If Briefly Summarized; For Others, This Account Will Provide A Handy Starting Point For Further Study Of The Bush Legacy.

Last year Joe wanted a fire-engine-red racecar with retracting headlights, and he did get one&#8212;but it was only three inches long. So this year Joe is really, really careful. He describes exactly what he wants, and on Christmas morning, he finds a living, breathing penguin named Osbert under the tree. Will anything in Joe&#8217;s life ever be the same? Now in a smaller hardcover edition, this hilarious romp through the land of be-careful-what-you-wish-for comes with its very own Osbert plush toy, in a beautiful package that makes for an utterly charming (and easy to care for) holiday gift.</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>Tired of not getting exactly what he wants from Santa Claus, a little boy sends very specific instructions for a pet penguin. Of course, we must be careful what we wish for, since that wish just might come true. At first he is delighted with Osbert, his penguin. However, as the days pass, he realizes how difficult this gift is. The penguin has to go out in bitterly cold weather, take cold baths, and eat cold creamed herring for breakfast. Another letter to Santa soon sets things right. Osbert discovers he would rather live at the zoo. Next Christmas is still eleven months away, but it is none too soon for our little boy, who already knows what he wants. Humor abounds in both the text and illustrations as our little hero does not learn his lesson. This book is light and enjoyable, conveying the subtle message that Santa knows best what we should get. This boxed set includes a plush penguin wearing the name tag Osbert and a small version of the original book. The plush animal meets or exceeds U.S. Manufacturing standards and is safe for little ones since the eyes are embroidered. This will make a sweet little Christmas gift.

They See Love As A Response To Beauty, A Cosmic Force, A Motive For Social Action And A Means Of Ethical Education. Through Jokes And Flirtation They Reveal Their Attitudes To Love And Personal Relationships. Aristophanes, The Comic Poet, Tells A Haunting Myth About Our Long-lost Unity As Couples; Since Then, Each Of Us Has Been Looking For Our 'other Half'. Socrates Radically Rethinks The Nature Of Love, And Delivers A Massive Challenge To Ancient - And Modern - Romanticism. Finally, The Glamorous Alcibiades Appears, Drunk And Supported By A Courtesan, To Tell Us Why He Tried To Seduce Socrates - And Why He Failed. Full Of Drama, Humour And Sharply Drawn Characters, The Symposium Offers Profound Insights Into Gender Roles, Sex In Society And The Value Of Sublimating Our Basic Instincts.--book Jacket.

As His Novels Shaped His Life As Much As His Life Shaped His Novels, Smiley's Charles Dickens Is At Once A Sensitive Profile Of The Great Master And A Fascinating Meditation On The Writing Life. Smiley Evokes Dickens As He Might Have Seemed To His Contemporaries: Convivial, Astute, Boundlessly Energetic-and Lionized. As She Makes Clear, Dickens Not Only Led The Action-packed Life Of A Prolific Writer, Editor, And Family Man But, Balancing The Artistic And The Commercial In His Work, He Also Consciously Sustained His Status As One Of The First Modern Celebrities. Charles Dickens Offers Brilliant Interpretations Of Almost All The Major Works, An Exploration Of His Narrative Techniques And His Innovative Voice And Themes, And A Reflection On How His Richly Varied Lower-class Cameos Sprang From An Experience And Passion More Personal Than His Public Knew. Jane Smiley Touches, Too, On Controversial Details That Include Dickens's Obsession With Money And Squabbles With Publishers, His Unhappy Marriage, And The Rumors Of An Affair. Here Is A Fresh Look At The Dazzling Personality Of A Verbal Magician And The Fascinating Times Behind The Classics We Read In School And Continue To Enjoy Today. Jane Smiley. A Penguin Life.

On Tina's class trip to the zoo, a penguin throws himself at her feet. She smuggles him out dressed in her coat and her pink beret. Levert's gouache illustration shows Tina on the bus talking to her girlfriend, oblivious both to ugly plastic insects held out by marauding boys and to the penguin, mute and goggle-eyed beside them. Tina spends the rest of her time trying to make the penguin comfortable in her room while evading her mother's questions about the new stuffed toy on her bed (Oh, that penguin. I got him at the zoo). She feeds him sardines and sleeps with the window open, but when she finds him standing in the refrigerator and has to pick his feathers out of the jam, she admits, I don't think this is working out. The next morning, the penguin disappears. However, a television special about Antarctica gives her a glimpse of a penguin in a pink beret. The tale doesn't provide all the satisfactions of typical alien-hidden-in-the-bedroom stories; Tina never has much fun with her penguin nor does she get a chance to display much heroism once she helps him flee from the zoo. But Levert's whimsical illustrations make up the deficit. Ages 5-8. (Sept.) Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.</p>",Tina and the Penguin,tina-and-the-penguin

Painter, Filmmaker, Photographer, Philosopher, Warhol Was Both Celebrity And Celebrant, The Man Who Put The Pop In Art. His Studio, The Factory, Where His Free-spirited Cast Of Superstars Mingled With The Rich And Famous, Was Ground Zero For The Explosions That Rocked American Cultural Life. And Yet For All His Fame, Warhol Was An Enigma: A Participant In The Excesses Of His Time Who Remained A Faithful Churchgoer, A Nearly Inarticulate Man Who Was Also A Great Aphorist (in The Future, Everyone Will Be World-famous For Fifteen Minutes), An Artist Whose Body Of Work Sizzles With Sexuality But Whose Own Body Was A Source Of Shame And Self-hatred. In His Account Of Warhol's Life And Work, Scholar And Culture Critic Wayne Koestenbaum Gets Past The Contradictions And Reveals The Man Beneath The Blond Wig And Dark Glasses. Nimbly Weaving Brilliant And Witty Analysis Into An Absorbing Narrative, Koestenbaum Approaches Warhol As A Serious Artist, One Whose Importance Goes Beyond The Sixties. Focusing On Warhol's Provocative, Powerful Films (many Of Which Have Been Out Of Circulation Since Their Initial Release), Koestenbaum Shows That Warhol's Oeuvre, In Its Variety Of Forms (films, Silkscreens, Books, Happenings), Maintains A Striking Consistency Of Theme: Warhol Discovered In Classic American Images (brillo Boxes, Campbell Soup Cans, Marilyn's Face) A Secret History, An Erotics Of Time And Space.--jacket.

It Is A Quintessential Tale Of Suspense And Horror, Boasting One Of The Most Terrifying Characters Ever Born In Literature&#58; Count Dracula, A Tragic, Night-dwelling Specter Who Feeds Upon The Blood Of The Living, And Whose Diabolical Passions Prey Upon The Innocent, The Helpless, And The Beautiful. But <i>dracula</i> Also Stands As A Bleak Allegorical Saga Of An Eternally Cursed Being Whose Nocturnal Atrocities Reflect The Dark Underside Of The Supremely Moralistic Age In Which It Was Originally Written &#151; And The Corrupt Desires That Continue To Plague The Modern Human Condition.</p><h3>1897 London Times Review Monday August 23rd</h3><p>dracula Cannot Be Described As A Domestic Novel, Nor Its Annals As Those Of A Quiet Life. The Circumstances Described Are From The First Peculiar. A Young Solicitor Sent For On Business By A Client In Transylvania Goes Through Some Unusual Experiences. He Finds Himself Shut Up In A Half Ruined Castle With A Host Who Is Only Seen At Night And Three Beautiful Females Who Have The Misfortune Of Being Vampires. Their Intentions, Which Can Hardly Be Described As Honourable, Are To Suck His Blood, In Order To Sustain Their Own Vitality. Count Dracula (the Host) Is Also A Vampire But Has Grown Tired Of His Compatriots, However Young And Beautiful, And Has A Great Desire For What May Literally Be Called Fresh Blood. He Has Therefore Sent For The Solicitor That Through His Means He May Be Introduced To London Society. Without Understanding The Count's Views, Mr. Harker Has Good Reason For Having Suspicions Of His Client. Wolves Come At His Command, And Also Fogs; He Is Also Too Clever By Half At Climbing. There Is A Splendid Prospect From The Castle Terrace, Which Mr. Harker Would Have Enjoyed But For His Conviction That He Would Never Leave The Place Alive-<br>. . .<br> These Scenes And Situations, Striking As They Are, Become Commonplace Compared With Count Dracula's Goings On In London. As Falstaff Was Not Only Witty Himself But The Cause Of Wit In Other People, So A Vampire, It Seems, Compels Those It Has Bitten (two Little Marks On The Throat Are Its Token, Usually Taken By Faculty For The Scratches Of A Broach) To Become After Death Vampires Also. Nothing Can Keep Them Away But Garlic, Which Is, Perhaps, Why That Comestible Is So Popular In Certain Countries. One May Imagine, Therefore,how The Thing Spread In London After The Count's Arrival. The Only Chance Of Stopping It Was To Kill The Count Before Any Of His Victims Died, And This Was A Difficult Job, For Though Several Centuries Old, He Was Very Young And Strong, And Could Become A Dog Or A Bat At Pleasure. However, It Is Undertaken By Four Resolute And High-principled Persons, And How It Is Managed Forms The Subject Of The Story, Of Which Nobody Can Complain That It Is Deficient In Dramatic Situations. We Would Not However, Recommend It To Nervous Persons For Evening Reading.</p>",Dracula (penguin Classics Series),Dracula (penguin Classics Series)

It Is Also An Important Source Of Information On The Byzantine War With The Normans, And On The First Crusade, In Which Alexius Participated. While The Byzantines Were Allied To The Crusaders, They Were None The Less Critical Of Their Behaviour And Anna's Book Offers A Startlingly Different Perspective From That Of Western Historians. Her Character Sketches Are Shrewd And Forthright - From The Norman Invader Robert Guiscard ('nourished By Manifold Evil') And His Son Bohemond ('like A Streaking Thunderbolt') To Pope Gregory Vii ('unworthy Of A High Priest'). The Alexiad Is A Vivid And Dramatic Narrative, Which Reveals As Much About The Character Of Its Intelligent And Dynamic Author As It Does About The Fascinating Period Through Which She Lived.

On Tina's Class Trip To The Zoo, A Penguin Throws Himself At Her Feet. She Smuggles Him Out Dressed In Her Coat And Her Pink Beret. Levert's Gouache Illustration Shows Tina On The Bus Talking To Her Girlfriend, Oblivious Both To Ugly Plastic Insects Held Out By Marauding Boys And To The Penguin, Mute And Goggle-eyed Beside Them. Tina Spends The Rest Of Her Time Trying To Make The Penguin Comfortable In Her Room While Evading Her Mother's Questions About The New Stuffed Toy On Her Bed (oh, That Penguin. I Got Him At The Zoo). She Feeds Him Sardines And Sleeps With The Window Open, But When She Finds Him Standing In The Refrigerator And Has To Pick His Feathers Out Of The Jam, She Admits, I Don't Think This Is Working Out. The Next Morning, The Penguin Disappears. However, A Television Special About Antarctica Gives Her A Glimpse Of A Penguin In A Pink Beret. The Tale Doesn't Provide All The Satisfactions Of Typical Alien-hidden-in-the-bedroom Stories; Tina Never Has Much Fun With Her Penguin Nor Does She Get A Chance To Display Much Heroism Once She Helps Him Flee From The Zoo.

It is a quintessential tale of suspense and horror, boasting one of the most terrifying characters ever born in literature&#58; Count Dracula, a tragic, night-dwelling specter who feeds upon the blood of the living, and whose diabolical passions prey upon the innocent, the helpless, and the beautiful. But <i>Dracula</i> also stands as a bleak allegorical saga of an eternally cursed being whose nocturnal atrocities reflect the dark underside of the supremely moralistic age in which it was originally written &#151; and the corrupt desires that continue to plague the modern human condition.</p><h3>1897 London Times review Monday August 23rd</h3><p>DRACULA cannot be described as a domestic novel, nor its annals as those of a quiet life. The circumstances described are from the first peculiar. A young solicitor sent for on business by a client in Transylvania goes through some unusual experiences. He finds himself shut up in a half ruined castle with a host who is only seen at night and three beautiful females who have the misfortune of being vampires. Their intentions, which can hardly be described as honourable, are to suck his blood, in order to sustain their own vitality. Count Dracula (the host) is also a vampire but has grown tired of his compatriots, however young and beautiful, and has a great desire for what may literally be called fresh blood. He has therefore sent for the solicitor that through his means he may be introduced to London society. Without understanding the Count's views, Mr. Harker has good reason for having suspicions of his client. Wolves come at his command, and also fogs; he is also too clever by half at climbing. There is a splendid prospect from the castle terrace, which Mr. Harker would have enjoyed but for his conviction that he would never leave the place alive-<br>. . .<br> These scenes and situations, striking as they are, become commonplace compared with Count Dracula's goings on in London. As Falstaff was not only witty himself but the cause of wit in other people, so a vampire, it seems, compels those it has bitten (two little marks on the throat are its token, usually taken by faculty for the scratches of a broach) to become after death vampires also. Nothing can keep them away but garlic, which is, perhaps, why that comestible is so popular in certain countries. One may imagine, therefore,how the thing spread in London after the Count's arrival. The only chance of stopping it was to kill the Count before any of his victims died, and this was a difficult job, for though several centuries old, he was very young and strong, and could become a dog or a bat at pleasure. However, it is undertaken by four resolute and high-principled persons, and how it is managed forms the subject of the story, of which nobody can complain that it is deficient in dramatic situations. We would not however, recommend it to nervous persons for evening reading.</p>",Dracula (Penguin Classics Series),dracula

It is a quintessential tale of suspense and horror, boasting one of the most terrifying characters ever born in literature&#58; Count Dracula, a tragic, night-dwelling specter who feeds upon the blood of the living, and whose diabolical passions prey upon the innocent, the helpless, and the beautiful. But <i>Dracula</i> also stands as a bleak allegorical saga of an eternally cursed being whose nocturnal atrocities reflect the dark underside of the supremely moralistic age in which it was originally written &#151; and the corrupt desires that continue to plague the modern human condition.</p><h3>1897 London Times review Monday August 23rd</h3><p>DRACULA cannot be described as a domestic novel, nor its annals as those of a quiet life. The circumstances described are from the first peculiar. A young solicitor sent for on business by a client in Transylvania goes through some unusual experiences. He finds himself shut up in a half ruined castle with a host who is only seen at night and three beautiful females who have the misfortune of being vampires. Their intentions, which can hardly be described as honourable, are to suck his blood, in order to sustain their own vitality. Count Dracula (the host) is also a vampire but has grown tired of his compatriots, however young and beautiful, and has a great desire for what may literally be called fresh blood. He has therefore sent for the solicitor that through his means he may be introduced to London society. Without understanding the Count's views, Mr. Harker has good reason for having suspicions of his client. Wolves come at his command, and also fogs; he is also too clever by half at climbing. There is a splendid prospect from the castle terrace, which Mr. Harker would have enjoyed but for his conviction that he would never leave the place alive-<br>. . .<br> These scenes and situations, striking as they are, become commonplace compared with Count Dracula's goings on in London. As Falstaff was not only witty himself but the cause of wit in other people, so a vampire, it seems, compels those it has bitten (two little marks on the throat are its token, usually taken by faculty for the scratches of a broach) to become after death vampires also. Nothing can keep them away but garlic, which is, perhaps, why that comestible is so popular in certain countries. One may imagine, therefore,how the thing spread in London after the Count's arrival. The only chance of stopping it was to kill the Count before any of his victims died, and this was a difficult job, for though several centuries old, he was very young and strong, and could become a dog or a bat at pleasure. However, it is undertaken by four resolute and high-principled persons, and how it is managed forms the subject of the story, of which nobody can complain that it is deficient in dramatic situations. We would not however, recommend it to nervous persons for evening reading.</p>",Dracula (Penguin Classics Series),dracula

In Some Respects, Canada Makes Most Sense When Viewed From The Outside In, And In The Penguin History Of Canada We Are Invited To Do Just That. The World Has Always Seen Canada As A Terrain For Experiment And A Land Of Opportunity. At First Canada's Survival And, Later, Its Prosperity Depended On Links With The World Outside - The Technologies That Drove Steamships And Trains Across Oceans And Continents; The Armies That Battled For North America; The Furs, Wheat, And Gold That Bought Canada A Place In The World's Trading System. An Uneasy And Difficult Country, Most Of Canada's Space Is Uninhabited, And Much Uninhabitable. It Is A Country With A Huge North But With Most Of Its Population In The South, Hugging The American Border. Canada Has Nevertheless Defied The Odds: It Remains, In The Twenty-first Century, A Haven Of Peace And A Beacon Of Prosperity. Erudite Yet Accessible And Marked By Narrative Flair, The Penguin History Of Canada Paints An Expansive Portrait Of A Dynamic And Complex Country.

Tracking these unique sea birds during their mating season, the authors photographed their habitat and lifestyle. The pictures are clear and the explanations are detailed.

It was Rousseau, the Father of the Romantic Movement, who was responsible for introducing at least two modern-day thoughts that pervade academia&#58; (1) Free expression of the creative spirit is more important than strict adhesion to formal rules and traditional procedures, and (2) Man is innately good but is corrupted by society and civilization.<P>The Confessions is Rousseau's landmark autobiography. Both brilliant and flawed, it is nonetheless beautifully written and remains one of the most moving human documents in all of literature. In this work, Rousseau frankly and sincerely settles accounts with himself in an effort to project his true image to the world. In so doing, he reveals the details of a man who paid little regard to accepted morality and social conventions.</p>",The Confessions (Penguin Classics),the-confessions

Realizing thJuneat 41 percent of the world&#8217;s population of African penguins could perish, local conservation officials immediately launched a massive rescue operation, and 12,500 volunteers from around the globe rushed to South Africa in hopes of saving the imperiled birds.Serving as a rehabilitation manager during the initial phase of the three-month rescue effort, Dyan deNapoli&#8212;better known as the Penguin Lady for her extensive work with penguins&#8212;and fellow volunteers de-oiled, nursed back to health, and released into the wild nearly all of the affected birds. Now, at the tenth anniversary of the disaster, deNapoli recounts this extraordinary true story of the world&#8217;s largest and most successful wildlife rescue. When she first entered the enormous warehouse housing most of the 19,000 oiled penguins, the birds&#8217; total silence told deNapoli all she needed to know about the extent of their trauma. African penguins are very vocal by nature, prone to extended fits of raucous, competitive braying during territorial displays and pair-bonding rituals, but these poor creatures now stood silently, shoulder to shoulder, in a state of shock. DeNapoli vividly details the harrowing rescue process and the heartbreaking scenarios she came up against alongside thousands of volunteers&#58; unforgettable images of them laboriously scrubbing the oil from every penguin feather and force-feeding each individually; the excruciatingly painful penguin bites every volunteer received; and the wrenching decisions about birds too ill to survive. She draws readers headfirst into the exhausting physical and emotional experience and brings to life the cast of remarkable characters&#8212;from Big Mike, a compassionate Jiu-Jitsu champion with a booming voice, who worked every day of the rescue effort; to a man named Welcome, aka the Penguin Whisperer, who had the amazing ability to calm any penguin he held in his arms; to Louis, a seventeen-year-old medical student who created a new formula for the highly effective degreaser used by the rescue mission&#8212;whose historic and heroic efforts saved the birds from near extinction. The extraordinary international collaboration of scientists, zookeepers, animal rescue groups, and thousands of concerned individuals helped save the African penguins&#8212;recently declared an endangered species&#8212;from an all-too-common man-made disaster.<P>DeNapoli&#8217;s heartwarming and riveting story is not just a portrait of these captivating birds, nor is it merely a cautionary tale about the environment. It is also an inspirational chronicle of how following one&#8217;s passion can lead to unexpected, rewarding adventures&#8212;and illustrates not only how people from around the world can unite for a greater purpose, but how they can be extraordinarily successful when doing so. <i>The Great Penguin Rescue </i>will inspire readers to believe they <i>can </i>make a difference</p>","The Great Penguin Rescue: 40,000 Penguins, a Devastating Oil Spill, and the Inspiring Story of the World's Largest Animal Rescue, Vol. 8",the-great-penguin-rescue

Lee That Is Rarely Seen. But Now Roy Blount, Jr. Combines Acute Character Insight With Lively Storytelling And A Full-hearted Southern Directness To Craft This Unique, Personal Portrait. <p>fascinated By What Made Lee Into Such A Great, Though Reluctant, Leader, Blount Delves Into His Family History And His Personality. He Illustrates How, Descended From Two Illustrious Families, Lee Embodied The Best Of All Their Traits And Became Lincoln's First Choice To Lead The Union Troops In 1861. But Lee's Virginia Roots Drew Him, Instead, To The Confederate Command. Blount Vividly Conveys Not Only His Ambition And Courage But Also His Humility And Humor, And His Sorrowful Sense Of Responsibility For His Outnumbered, Outgunned, Half-starved Army. Robert E. Lee, The First Succinct Biography Of This American Legend, Will Appeal To History And Military Buffs, Proud Southerners, And Every Reader Curious To Dis-cover The Man Behind The Military Leader.</p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>this Concise Penguin Life Biography Can Be Compared To The Confederate General's Civil War Career: Valiant, Honorable And Surprisingly Successful With Limited Resources. Blount, A Humorist With 12 Books To His Credit, Avoids Hagiography, Debunking And Psychobiography (except In Speculation Largely Relegated To Appendix 1). Writing From The Perspective Of His Southern Heritage, Blount Exhibits Apposite Insight And Detachment, Instantly Recognizing Anything That Has Ever Been Used As A Club For Beating The South. As To The Actual Narrative, He Is Vividly Detailed About Lee's Disastrous Childhood, Which Led To His Famous Self-control. The Description Of His Civil War Career Supports Grant's Verdict Of Lee As Lucky On The Offensive But Really Formidable Only On The Defensive, And Avoids Jargon That Might Make The Military Passages Inaccessible To The Lay Reader. The Chapter On The Postwar Lee Is Perhaps The Most Moving Part Of The Book, Since It Is In That Period That The Ailing General Shows His Best Self: Advocating North-south Reconciliation, Refusing Lucrative Commercial Offers, And Reviving Washington College (now Washington-lee University) As Its President. This Effort Is Not Equal To Emory Thomas's Work, The Best One-volume Coverage Of A Subject Who Inspired Douglas Southall Freeman To Four. But As A Literate And Balanced Introduction To A Subject Whose Complexity Too Many Current Writers Avoid, This Book Deserves A Most Respectable Ranking Among Today's Civil War Literature.

Many Subsequent Publications On Bakst Issued By Various American/western European Publishers Are Based On This Very Edition. Léon Bakst (1866-1924), A Leading Russian Artist, Was A Highly Energetic Founding Member Of The Mir Iskusstva [world Of Art] Association, A Group Organized In St. Petersburg In The Late 1890s By Artists And Art Lovers, Led By Alexander Benois And Sergei Diaghilev. Its Membership Included Many Gifted Painters And Graphic Artists, Not Only In St. Petersburg But Also In Moscow, Among Them Ivan Bilibin, Alexander Golovin, Igor Grabar, Konstantin Korovin, Boris Kustodiev, Nikolai Roerich And Valentin Serov. Bakst Was Widely Acclaimed As A Portraitist, Book Illustrator And Landscape Painter, Though His Style Was Seen To Best Advantage In The Work He Did For The Theatre. His Designs For Stage Sets And Costumes Are Conspicuous For Their Riotous Fantasy, Astounding Beauty And Historical Authenticity. As The Leading Designer For The Ballets Russes, Which Sergei Diaghilev Promoted Abroad, Bakst Made A Unique Contribution To The Popularization Of Russian Art In Western Europe.

Everyone Ends Up At Play Park, But Only Dora And Boots Seem To Be Enjoying The Food They Brought. The Main Attraction Is The 3-d Plastic Animal Figures, Not The Story, Which Is Quite Illogical. These Animals Would Not Be Together At A Play Park, And Sensible Dora Should Not Be Fraternizing With Bears And Crocodiles. Meeting And Naming The Animals May Be The Purpose, But Other Books Can Probably Do The Job Better, Such As <i>i See A Kookaburra!: Discovering Animal Habitats Around The World</i> Or <i>the Wildlife Abc & 123: A Nature Alphabet & Counting Book</i>.</p>",Meet The Animals!

Delivered In New York In February 1860, The Cooper Union Speech Dispelled Doubts About Lincoln's Suitability For The Presidency And Reassured Conservatives Of His Moderation While Reaffirming His Opposition To Slavery To Republican Progressives.<p>award-winning Lincoln Scholar Harold Holzer Places Lincoln And His Speech In The Context Of The Times &#151; An Era Of Racism, Politicized Journalism, And Public Oratory As Entertainment &#151; And Shows How The Candidate Framed The Speech As An Opportunity To Continue His Famous Debates With His Archrival Democrat Stephen A. Douglas On The Question Of Slavery.<p>holzer Describes The Enormous Risk Lincoln Took By Appearing In New York, Where He Exposed Himself To The Country's Most Critical Audience And Took On Republican Senator William Henry Seward Of New York, The Front Runner, In His Own Backyard. Then He Recounts A Brilliant And Innovative Public Relations Campaign, As Lincoln Took The Speech On The Road In His Successful Quest For The Presidency.<br></p> <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> <p>few People Know More About Abraham Lincoln Than Holzer (editor Of Lincoln The Writer; Lincoln Seen And Heard; Etc.). This Fine New Work Focuses On A Widely Known But Little Studied Address That Lincoln Delivered Early In 1860 In New York City, Which Holzer Believes Made Lincoln The Republican Candidate And Therefore President. While One Has To Credit Other Political And Historical Factors, Holzer Is Probably Right. Surely No One Will Again Overlook This Masterful Speech, Even If It Never Rose To The Eloquence Of The Gettysburg Address. That's Precisely One Of Holzer's Main Arguments: That The Speech Was Intended As A Learned, Historically Grounded, Legally Powerful Rebuttal To Claims Of Lincoln's Great Democratic Opponent, Stephen Douglas, About The Constitutionality Of Slavery's Spread Into The Territories. But How, Holzer Asks, Did A Long Speech Hold Its Audience At Cooper Union And Then Infuse Tens, Perhaps Hundreds Of Thousands Of Newspaper Readers With Enthusiasm For The Man? The Answer Lies In Large Part With The Nature Of American Culture A Highly Politicized One Of Readers In The 1860s. But As Holzer Also Makes Clear, Lincoln Conceived Of The Speech As Part Of An Astute Strategy To Win His Party's Nomination. While His Political Wizardry Will Surprise Few Readers, They'll Learn Again How It Was Combined With Intellectual Power And A Fierce Determination To Clarify His Moral Convictions. It Was On This Visit To New York That Matthew Brady Shot His Most Celebrated Portrait Of Lincoln (which Appears On The Book Jacket). Holzer Devotes A Fascinating Chapter To This Episode.

Taney Over Slavery, Secession, And Lincoln's Constitutional War Powers Went To The Heart Of Lincoln's Presidency.james F. Simon Skillfully Brings To Life This Compelling Story Of The Momentous Tug-of-war Between The President And The Chief Justice During The Worst Crisis In The Nation's History.</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>this Surprisingly Taut And Gripping Book By Nyu Law Professor Simon (what Kind Of Nation) Examines The Limits Of Presidential Prerogative During The Civil War. Lincoln And Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney Saw Eye To Eye On Certain Matters; Both, For Example, Disliked Slavery. But Beginning In 1857, When Lincoln Criticized Taney's Decision In The Dred Scott Case, The Pair Began To Spar. They Diverged Further Once Lincoln Became President When Taney Insisted That Secession Was Constitutional And Preferable To Bloodshed, And Blamed The Civil War On Lincoln. In 1861, Taney Argued That Lincoln's Suspension Of Habeas Corpus Was Illegal. This Holding Was, Simon Argues, A Clarion Call For The President To Respect The Civil Liberties Of American Citizens. In An 1862 Group Of Cases, Taney Joined A Minority Opinion That Lincoln Lacked The Authority To Order The Seizure Of Southern Ships. Had Taney Had The Chance, Suggests Simon, He Would Have Declared The Emancipation Proclamation Unconstitutional; He And Lincoln Agreed That The Constitution Left Slavery Up To Individual States, But Lincoln Argued That The President's War Powers Trumped States' Rights. Simon's Focus On Lincoln And Taney Makes For A Dramatic, Charged Narrative And The Focus On Presidential War Powers Makes This Historical Study Extremely Timely. (nov.)

But six years later, when a skeletal Wiesenthal was liberated from the concentration camp at Mauthausen, he fully fathomed the crimes of the Nazis. Within days he had assembled a list of nearly 150 Nazi war criminals, the first of dozens of such lists he would make over a lifetime as a Nazi hunter. A hero in the eyes of many, Wiesenthal was also attacked for his unrelenting pursuit of the past, when others preferred to forget.<P>For this new biography, rich in newsworthy revelations, historian and journalist Tom Segev has obtained access to Wiesenthal&rsquo;s private papers and to sixteen archives, including records of the U.S., Israeli, Polish, and East German secret services. Segev is able to reveal the intriguing secrets of Wiesenthal&rsquo;s life, including his stunning role in the capture of Adolf Eichmann, his relationship with Israel&rsquo;s Mossad, his controversial investigative techniques, his unlikely friendships with Kurt Waldheim and Albert Speer, and the nature of his rivalry with Elie Wiesel.<P>Segev&rsquo;s challenge in writing this biography was Wiesenthal&rsquo;s own complicated relationship to truth. Wiesenthal told many versions of his life, his suffering in the camps, and his involvement with the arrest of individual Nazis. Segev shows that in order to gain the information he sought and twist the arms of reluctant government figures, Wiesenthal needed to seem more influential than he really was.<P>For two generations of Americans, Simon Wiesenthal was a Jewish superhero&mdash;depicted on film by Ben Kingsley and Laurence Olivier&mdash;and the muse for a Frederick Forsyth thriller. Now Segev demonstrates that the truth of Wiesenthal&rsquo;s existence is as compelling as the fiction. <i>Simon Wiesenthal</i> is an unforgettable life of one of the great men of the twentieth century.</p> <h3>The New York Times - Dwight Garner</h3> <p>&#8230;meticulous and forceful&#8230;[Segev's] book delivers not merely an intimate account of Wiesenthal's life and times, but also judicious examinations of the many controversial and little-known aspects of that life&#8230;It cannot have been simple work for Mr. Segev to sort out all of Wiesenthal's stories, but sort he does. It's one of his biography's achievements that you see its subject absolutely plain. Mr. Segev admires Wiesenthal but does not turn away from the sketchier aspects of his personality.</p>",Simon Wiesenthal: The Life and Legends,simon-wiesenthal

Still, this account is exceptionally one-sided. Born into a religious family in Galicia, Wiesenthal was trained as an architect but has spent the time since his liberation from Mauthausen concentration camp documenting the hideous crimes of individual Nazis, particularly members of the SS, and trying to bring those still living to justice. His work immediately after the war did provide invaluable information to the prosecutors at Nuremberg, but, ironically, his fame rests on an event he was less closely involved withthe arrest of Adolph Eichmann, the ultimate desk murderer. Wiesenthal has long claimed to have been instrumental in Eichmann's capture in Argentina, but that interpretation has been contradicted by the leader of the Israeli undercover team. Wiesenthal has other enemies as well, and Pick laboriously details each argument and misunderstanding between Wiesenthal and leaders of various Jewish organizations and Austrian politicians. She is familiar with the torturous and nasty workings of Austrian politics, but readers might have been more interested in why Wiesenthal chose to live in such a virulently anti-Semitic country.

Simon copes with a job that has become routine, and struggles with divorce, finding release and strength in his horses. A new woman, lovely, intelligent, and independent, challenges Simon's outlook that seems old-fashioned in a rapidly changing world. Several years younger and of a different race, she causes him to explore his past, from abandonment as a child to the youthful adventures in the harsh world of the Canadian wilderness.

His imagination leads him to all kinds of wonderful adventures. With the help of his friend, Marlene, and with his own special spirit, Simon makes each season a memorable one.<br><br>Simon welcomes spring &#8212; As the snow begins to melt, Simon decides he will hurry spring&#8217;s arrival. When his drum fails to call it forth, he tries fantastic but charmingly imaginative ways to pull flowers from the earth, tempt birds to return, and encourage bears to awaken &#8212; only to discover that spring will come in its own time, despite what we try to do to make it come any sooner.<br><br>Simon in summer &#8212; Simon loves summer so much that he never wants it to end. When he sees the first signs of fall, he seeks advice from a heron and a cow, who tell him how to make summer last. Simon tries by making the frogs sing, pleasing the butterflies with paper flowers, and keeping the sun high in the sky.<br><br>Simon and the wind &#8212; Simon tries to use the wind to fly. As he blows bubbles into the breeze, he thinks he can make one large enough to carry him. His friend Marlene brings him a cardboard box, and Simon asks the birds to carry it like a plane across the sky. Finally, Simon learns he cannot fly, but discovers a game he and his friends can play with the wind.<br><br>Simon and the snowflakes &#8212; Simon is curious. He wants to know how many snowflakes fall in a snowstorm, but they come down too fast to count. When he learns that there are as many snowflakes as stars in the sky, he tries to count them too, but they race across the night sky. Simon decides to visit his friends in the forest and finds something much better to count there.</p><h3>Children's Literature</h3><p>The previously published adventures of cocky young Simon in each season are collected here to take young readers through the year. Simon expresses his delight in the activities he can pursue as the seasons pass. He loves the spring, the arrival of flowers and birds. He loves the warm sun of summer, the frogs, the butterflies. In autumn he keeps busy blowing bubbles, saying goodbye to the birds, and waiting for the clouds to clear so he can fly his kite. Finally, he loves the snowflakes of winter and the stars in the winter sky. And throughout the year, he enjoys his time with his friends. The somewhat textured full-page illustrations are subtly designed, using colors to support the mood of each season. Simon's head is round; it needs only a couple of dots for eyes and lines for nose and lips to express his feelings. The softness of sky and landscape suggests the use of airbrush. The frequent appearance of naturalistic birds, frogs, and butterflies add a bit to the overall environments that are a bit dreamy but reality based.</p>",Simon Says: Seasons,simon-says

The school's amenities notwithstanding, Charles has enrolled simply in order to meet Graeme Brandt, a senior, and author of a YA novel that Charles finds brilliant in its send-up of people's shallowness (Life is just one big game of Simon Says.... Nobody even wants to admit they're playing). Charles, who now refuses to let others see his paintings, is hoping that Graeme can show him how to get beyond the game... show me how to keep from locking myself away inside a studio forever. While the boys connect immediately, Charles realizes that Graeme is also playing, just like Graeme's protagonist (He knew what Simon wanted before Simon even said anything). When Charles pushes Graeme to find his true self (You're nothing but a lifeless mirror that reflects everyone's expectations!), Graeme commits suicide and camouflages it as a heart attack, leaving a note explaining his actions to Charles. Alphin (Counterfeit Son) adds texture by inserting Graeme's journals between Charles's narration, and she brings unusual candor to her portrayal of gay characters. But while the author taps into adolescent visions of the artist's life and the difficulties of being an individual, her constant reiteration of these themes grows tiresome. Metaphors run a little thick, and the quagmires seemed overcooked. Ages 14-up. (May) Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.</p>",Simon Says,simon-says

Duncan (French, U. of Stirling, Scotland) proposes a new reading of Simon's work as written adventures, paying special attention to his major novels of the 1980s, The Georgics and The Acania. The excerpts are translated in the endnotes, making the text quite broken for non-French readers. Distributed in the US by St. Martin's Press. Annotation c.

Hartley presents the first thorough, objective volume on the journalistic and political career of one of Illinois&#8217;s most respected public figures. Hartley&#8217;s detailed account offers a fully rounded portrait of a man whose ideals and tenacity not only spurred reform on both state and national levels during his celebrated forty-year career but also established the lasting legacy of a political legend. </P><p>Simon first became a public figure at the age of nineteen, when he assumed the post of editor and publisher of a weekly newspaper in Troy, Illinois. From there, he used his paper to launch a fierce crusade against the crime and corruption plaguing Madison County. This battle sparked his entry into politics, helping to land him a seat in the state legislature in 1954. While serving, he campaigned tirelessly according to his principles, earning him the mass voter approval that would usher him into the seat of lieutenant governor in 1968&#8212;the first person elected to that position who did not share party affiliation with the governor.</P><p>As lieutenant governor, Simon initiated many changes to the position, remaking it to better serve the citizens of the state of Illinois. The cornerstone of his reform plan was an ombudsman program designed to allow the people of the state to voice problems they had with government and state agencies. The program, extremely popular with the public and the press, solved problems and helped to make Simon a household name throughout Illinois. Although he faced challenges along the way, including racial upheaval in Cairo and the student andpolice riots on the Carbondale campus of Southern Illinois University, Simon&#8217;s outspoken honesty and strong support of his constituents earned him the utmost esteem and popularity. </P><p>While his 1972 bid for governor of Illinois ultimately failed, this did not deter Simon from his dedication to social progress. In 1974 he began his remarkable twenty-two-year career in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, where he earned the admiration of the country for his political integrity. Despite the praise and support Simon had earned during his time in Washington, he was unable to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and returned to the Senate, winning a second term in 1990. &nbsp;Simon committed time and energy to the myriad issues of interest to him, especially in the field of education, with one of his biggest successes coming with the passage of the National Literacy Act, which he sponsored. He continued to foster his ties to journalism throughout his lengthy political career, authoring numerous books, articles, and columns, all of which he used to relentlessly promote open government and social programs.</P><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This vivid account of the public life of Paul Simon reveals a man whose personal honor and dedication were unshakeable throughout nearly half a century in the political arena. Robert E. Hartley provides a candid perspective on Simon&#8217;s accomplishments and victories, as well as his mistakes and losses, revealing new insights into the life of this dynamic and widely respected public figure.</P><p>&nbsp;</P></p> <h3>Illinois Times</h3> <p>Paul Simon kindles memories of Frank Capra's classic 1939 film, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The fictional drama features Jefferson Smith, a wholesome idealist played by James Stewart. Maintaining uncommon integrity while occupying a seat in the United States Senate, Smith emerges as a lonely voice against the corruption and unbridled cynicism often rampant in American politics.<br>Fast forward to the long political career of Paul Simon and one can easily see a real-life incarnation of Jefferson Smith. In his years as a leading state political figure and then as a congressman and United States senator, Simon held the high ground with a ferocious consistency that stamped him in the public eye as a politician who never, ever betrayed or lost the public trust. That put him in select company. It made him, well, an Illinois original. Robert E. Hartley realizes this originality and incorporates it in the title of his first-rate book, Paul Simon&#58; The Political Journey of an Illinois Original.<br>During his 40 years in public office, Simon received heavy press coverage, beginning in 1954 with his surprising election to the Illinois House of Representatives (when he was a 25-year-old newspaper publisher), through his final term in the U.S. Senate in the 1990s. His virtues and political triumphs were extolled, and his several political setbacks - such as his failure to win the Illinois governorship in 1972 and his abortive bid for the White House in 1988 - were chronicled.<br>Still, an objective analysis of Simon and his career (irrespective of his own autobiography published in 1999) was lacking. Until now.<br>Hartley has filled this void with an incisive dissection of the background, influences and experiences that shaped Simon's independent mindset. He does so in a telling fashion because of a knack, demonstrated in his previous books, for scholarly research and tapping resources that produce heretofore unknown insights. Hartley's skill as an ardent digger for information was readily visible in his books on other major Illinois political figures, including Charles H. Percy, James R. Thompson and Paul Powell. Some readers who think they already know a lot about Simon are in for a detailed, but never boring, surprise.<br>Hartley's writing style is an appealing mix of the down-to-earth journalist (which he once was) and academic interpreter. Yet, he is in no way ivory-towerish. His manner with words is encompassing, quite suitable for the bulk of folks who are not political junkies.<br>Most likely, this will be the seminal book on Simon, particularly where the first part of his life story is concerned. Most of the book deals with his political career in Illinois - the years in which, after reaching the Illinois House, he was elected to the Illinois State Senate, the office of lieutenant governor and finally to a seat in Congress. Frankly, these are the years of greatest interest to most Illinois readers. It was the era in which Simon, a son of a Lutheran pastor, displayed the courage and political candor that made him a virtual folk hero for many individuals, especially in downstate Illinois.<br>The book retells with engrossing detail Simon's use of the Troy Tribune (the small paper he purchased for $3,500 in 1948) to fight political corruption in Madison County. This journalistic fervor won him acclaim, which he translated six years later into his successful race for the Illinois House as a Democrat. His victory surprised none more than the old-line Democrats who ruled the party in that part of the state. It launched the start of Simon's never-ending independence from party machine bosses.<br>In the House, Simon became part of a cadre of Young Turks or Democratic mavericks who challenged their own party's entrenched leaders (like Paul Powell), as well as Republicans, on questionable doings or issues. A compatriot of Simon in those years was Belleville's Alan J. Dixon, another young Democratic upstart in the House. The political careers of Simon and Dixon would be intertwined from that point on, as each progressed in a parallel fashion to the Illinois Senate, then statewide office and, lastly, to Washington (where Dixon went directly to the Senate while Simon served first in the House before election to the Senate). After decades, the two continued to be viewed as political boy wonders.<br>Simon never lost the innocent look of a bespectacled choir boy. He also never abandoned his journalistic roots, putting together a chain of small newspapers (eventually sold), and writing numerous newspaper columns and books. The ink in his veins abetted his unusually close ties to the press, first in Illinois and then in Washington.<br>Simon's name appears on little landmark legislation. But in Illinois and in the nation's capital the media easily recognized that he stood out because of his dogged pursuit of ethical behavior by elected and appointed officials. Insisting on the transparency of government operations, the man never ceased to be a good conscience of authority.<br>Bob Hartley brings all of this home in a book that certainly will bolster Hartley's reputation as a master recorder of modern Illinois political history.<br>the author of books about Illinois political leaders and gangsters. His next book, set for publication early in 2010, is Dapper & Deadly&#58; The True Story of Black Charlie Harris.<p>&#151; Taylor Pensoneau</p>",Paul Simon: The Political Journey of an Illinois Original,paul-simon

Police lieutenant Mick Callahan drives her to her parents' mansion in the Michigan hinterlands, then stays to keep her safe. Amid rural pleasures, the two fall in love despite the fears Mick carries after being betrayed by both his mother and his late wife. Though others are killed, Shelby encounters little danger until the evening of the local Halloween costume gala, where the culprit makes a final attempt on her life. McBride's letter bomb premise will strike many readers as implausible; her story displays an obvious lack of awareness of how a multi-state letter bombing campaign would play out in the post-9/11 world. In addition, Shelby emerges as smug, controlling and, for an advice columnist, wildly unobservant; among other blunders, she actually draws the bomber-someone she has ample clues to distrust-directions to her hideaway. Although McBride's portrait of the rough-edged yet sensitive Mick is drawn with winning depth and the marital sparring between Shelby's parents is funny and insightful, these virtues fail to offset the story's slapdash plotting and unsympathetic heroine.

The music in this book doesn't use standard notation. Instead, a simple system shows the guitar strings. Chord boxes show you where to place your fingers with your fretting hand; crosses on the strings show you the pattern to pick the strings. That's all there is to it! All the songs in this book have been specially arranged in the EASY PICKINGS format to make them as easy as possible. The first few songs have only a few chords and simple picking patterns; later in the book the songs have more chords and a greater variety of fingerpicking styles.</p>",Easy Pickings Paul Simon,easy-pickings-paul-simon

His Life, Passions, Battles, And Great Victories Became Embedded In Spanish American Culture Almost As Soon As They Happened. This Is The First Major English-language Biography Of &#147;the Liberator&#8221; In Half A Century.

A Cult Figure After His Death, In 1830, El Libertador Led A Life That Defies Easy Analysis: Although Influenced By Enlightenment Ideas Of Equality, He Rejected Total Democracy, Fearing Anarchy In The &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; Lower Classes; Determined To Create Strong Central Government, He Institutionalized Rule By Local Warlords; Acutely Aware Of The Factionalism Rampant In Postwar Society, He Was Bewildered When It Eventually Forced Him To Leave His Homeland. In Lynch&rsquo;s View, The Key To Bol&iacute;var Lies In His Pragmatism. Leaders Who Have Invoked His Name To Serve Their Political Agendas Have Obscured The Fact That His Policies Followed No Single Path And Are Meaningless Out Of Historical Context. The So-called &ldquo;bolivarian Revolution&rdquo; Of The Populist Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez Is &ldquo;a Modern Perversion Of The Cult.&rdquo;</p>",Simon Bolivar: A Life,Simon Bolivar: A Life

Catalog Of An Exhibition Held At The Museum Folkwang, Essen, Apr. 20-july 1. 2007. In Nachbau, ... Simon Starling Delves Into The Presentation Of Art In Shifting Historical And Architectural Contexts. His Starting Point Is The Museum Folkwang In Essen, Germany, One Of The First To Specialize In Modern Art, Founded At The Beginning Of The Last Century. In 1937, Some 1,400 Works From Its Collection--including Pieces By Artists Such As Matisse And Cèzanne--were Declared 'degenerate' And Locked Away By The Nazi Government. The Museum Itself Was Destroyed In 1944 And 1945, Rebuilt After The War, And Is Now About To Be Partially Demolished Once Again In The Course Of Renovations. Working In The Museum's Confines, Using Four Photographs Of Its Galleries Taken Between 1929 And 1944 By Albert Renger-patzsch, (a Key Photographer In The 'neue Sachlichkeit', Or 'new Objectivity'), Starling Reconstructs That Era's Art Placement And Surroundings In A Detailed, Film Set-like Installation, Bringing This Charged Historical Background Forward Into The Present. This Two-volume Artist's Book On The Project Documents And Elaborates On The Installation And Ideas It Explores: The Continuities, Transformations And Alterations That The Artist Shows Shaping Art And History--vendor Catalog.

Then He Meets A Tiger, Who Challenges Him To All Three Dares, With Increasing Difficulty. Will The Boy Best The Tiger, Or The Tiger Best The Boy?<br><br><br></p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>in The Tradition Of Clever Heroes Who Outwit Wily Animals, This Agreeable Picture Book Features An Unflappable Hero Who Is Anything But Simple. When Challenged By Various Animals, Simon Can Growl Like A Dog, Stretch Like A Cat And Jump Like A Horse. It's Simple, Says Simon. But When A Cunning Tiger Asks The Boy To Demonstrate His Skills, Simon Needs All His Wits About Him To Wriggle Out Of Becoming The Big Cat's Supper. Like The Work Of Ardizonne Or Zemach, So's (tasty Baby Belly Buttons) Watercolor-and-ink Illustrations Feature Loose Lines And A Strong Sense Of Movement. Unfortunately, The Expressiveness Of Her Animal Characters Is Often More Appealing Than That Of Simon Himself, Whose Face Sometimes Seems Inconsistently Drawn. Hoberman's (a House Is A House For Me) Text Borrows Devices Used By Familiar Fairy Tale And Nursery Rhyme Characters With Plenty Of Repeated Phrases And Actions. But Simon So Effortlessly Outmaneuvers The Tiger That The Outcome Doesn't Come As A Surprise. Nonetheless, So's Swirls Of Color And Animated Black Lines, Her Deliciously Sly Tiger And The Varied Design Of The Spreads And End Papers All Provide A Sense Of Energy And Excitement. Ages 4-8.

It is up to his faithful donkey, Sandy, to fulfill his duty. Sandy&#8217;s story is charmingly depicted in vibrant watercolors. Based on the true story of the intelligence and loyalty of Sandy the donkey who saved the day by delivering water to the island&#8217;s inhabitants.<p></p><h3>School Library Journal</h3><p><P>PreS-Gr 3<P> This story, handed down by word of mouth for many generations, is based on an actual event from the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is set on Grand Turk, which receives very little rain, at a time when there was no running water or plumbing, and donkeys carried water from two natural wells to the people. In this tale, Simon, with the help of his donkey, Sandy, takes water to the people of Cockburn Town every morning. One morning, Simon does not come out of his cottage, so the animal goes to the well, and then to each house. When the children call out, Where is Simon, Sandy? the donkey shakes her head and moves on to the next house. When she arrives at the doctor's, the man races to Simon's house and finds him with an injured foot. The children deliver the water each day until Simon is well. The simple folktale style of this story includes rapid plot development and descriptive language. Cultural facts are related through the illustrations, which provide insight into island life. The realistic, colorful pictures capture the emotions of the people and donkey. The author's note provides useful background about the setting and the story, and two maps show the location of the islands.-<I>Margaret R.

Zijn Grafische Oeuvre Ontstond In Een Periode Van 30 Jaar: De Eerste Etsen Maakte Koene In 1968 Als Student Aan De Koninklijke Academie, De Laatste Ets Vervaardigde Hij In 1998. Naar Eigen Zeggen Had Hij Toen De Mogelijkheden Van Dit Medium Zo Uitputtend Verkend Dat Het Hem Geen Artistieke Uitdaging Meer Bood. Nadien Zou Hij Zich Volledig Toeleggen Op Het Maken Van Schilderijen En Tekeningen. Koenes Grafische Oeuvre, Dat Bijna 300 Etsen Omvat En In Zijn Eigen Woorden Het Karakter Van Een Visueel Dagboek Draagt, Kenmerkt Zich Door Een Grote Diversiteit In Stijl En Onderwerpskeuze. Zijn Vroege Werk Is Sterk Verhalend Van Aard En Reflecteert Vaak Op Gebeurtenissen Uit De Actualiteit, Zoals De Oorlog In Vietnam, Kritiek Op De Consumptiemaatschappij, Songteksten Van De Beatles. Ook In Artistiek Opzicht Sluiten Koenes Vroege Prenten Aan Bij De Kunststromingen Uit De Tijd Van Hun Ontstaan. Zo Bevatten De Vroege Collages Pop-artachtige Elementen Die Aan Het Werk Van Robert Rauschenberg Doen Denken En Vertonen De Verhalende Voorstellingen Een Vormverwantschap Met Het Werk Van Ronald Kitaj. Later Legt Hij Zich Toe Op Een Uiterst Precieze Natuurweergave En Maakt Hij Onder Meer Een Indrukwekkende Reeks Prenten Met De Voormalige Abdijkerk Van Loosduinen Als Thema.

By simply reciting the formulas it contains, he can cancel gravity to fly around his bedroom, or decrease friction so he can slide down the street as if he were on Rollerblades. When two thugs with evil intentions come after Simon, he must use the formulas to save himself and the book from falling into their hands. This funny, fast, and imaginative novel from first-time author Michael Reisman will appeal to fans of both fantasy and action-adventure.</p><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3><p><P>Reisman's fast-paced, cinematic first novel, already optioned by Universal Studios, transcends its Spiderwickian premise to move in a different direction: it makes scientific concepts interesting and accessible. Like Newton's apple, a secret book-which contains so much power that it could become the most dangerous thing in existence-falls from above and hits the Everyboy protagonist, 11-year-old Simon Bloom from New Jersey, smack on the head. Titled the <I>Teacher's Edition of Physics</I>, it teachers Simon how to turn himself into an 11-year-old superhero. As he tells his friends, the super-cool Alysha and tiny, cowardly Owen, This Book tells me how science really works.... It only <I>looks</I>like magic if you don't understand. Using one of the book's formulas, he takes away Alysha's body's kinetic friction, and she slips and slides over dry forest leaves.The kids' personalities evolve as the book progresses, although the villains (they try to capture the book) are flat, stock characters. The narrator is British-all the best Narrators are from Great Britain-and members of an Order of Physics receive silly names, such as Ralfagon Wintrofline and Mermon Veenie. These mannerisms, by now familiar in novels for this target group, function almost as a kind of shorthand: kids who like ironic narration will like this title, too.

His imagination leads him to all kinds of wonderful adventures. With the help of his friend, Marlene, and with his own special spirit, Simon makes each season a memorable one.<br><br>Simon welcomes spring &#8212; As the snow begins to melt, Simon decides he will hurry spring&#8217;s arrival. When his drum fails to call it forth, he tries fantastic but charmingly imaginative ways to pull flowers from the earth, tempt birds to return, and encourage bears to awaken &#8212; only to discover that spring will come in its own time, despite what we try to do to make it come any sooner.<br><br>Simon in summer &#8212; Simon loves summer so much that he never wants it to end. When he sees the first signs of fall, he seeks advice from a heron and a cow, who tell him how to make summer last. Simon tries by making the frogs sing, pleasing the butterflies with paper flowers, and keeping the sun high in the sky.<br><br>Simon and the wind &#8212; Simon tries to use the wind to fly. As he blows bubbles into the breeze, he thinks he can make one large enough to carry him. His friend Marlene brings him a cardboard box, and Simon asks the birds to carry it like a plane across the sky. Finally, Simon learns he cannot fly, but discovers a game he and his friends can play with the wind.<br><br>Simon and the snowflakes &#8212; Simon is curious. He wants to know how many snowflakes fall in a snowstorm, but they come down too fast to count. When he learns that there are as many snowflakes as stars in the sky, he tries to count them too, but they race across the night sky. Simon decides to visit his friends in the forest and finds something much better to count there.</p>",Les Quatre Saisons de Simon,les-quatre-saisons-de-simon

But It Turns Out Not To Be Everything She Had Hoped. She Has To Be Co-drum Major With Drew, A Boy She Secretly Has A Crush On But Spends Most Of Her Time Arguing With. Nasty Rumors About How Virginia Won The Election Plague Her. Some Of Her Peers Insist She Slept With The Band Teacher, Others Say She Won The Whole Election, But Drew Was Also Given The Position So People Would Feel Less Offended That A Girl Won. Instead Of Feeling Powerful And Proud To Be The Town's First-ever Female Drum Major, She Struggles To Gain Respect. The Chasm Between Drew And Virginia Threatens To Destroy The Band, So Their Teacher Counsels Them To Be Honest With Each Other In An Effort To Work Better Together. They Reveal More Than Just Their Feelings About Band, But Quickly Find Their Romance At Risk Thanks To Rumors Both Old And New. <i>major Crush</i> Is Predictable And Has A Tendency To Drag. Neither The Writing Nor The Plot Is Particularly Noteworthy. However, Echols Still Manages To Create A Surprisingly Fun Read That Overcomes These Negatives. Though It Takes A While For Readers To Warm To The Characters, Virginia And Drew's Relationship Is Multifaceted Enough To Keep The Story Interesting. As The Novel Progresses, The Storyline Widens To Encompass More Serious Issues With Virginia's Parents, Her Best Friend Allison, And Drew's Home Life. This Is A Good Addition To Any Leisure Reading Collection. It Won't Challenge A Reader Much, But It Will Provide A Few Hours Of Light Entertainment.</p>",Major Crush (simon Romantic Comedies),Major Crush (simon Romantic Comedies)

But Simon Is A Deeply Private Person Who Has Resisted Speaking To Us Outside Of His Music. He Has Said He Will Not Write An Autobiography Or Memoir, And He Has Refused To Talk To Previous Biographers. Finally, Simon Has Opened Up--for More Than One Hundred Hours Of Interviews--to Robert Hilburn, Whose Biography Of Johnny Cash Was Named By Michiko Kakutani Of The New York Times As One Of Her Ten Favorite Books Of 2013. The Result Is A Landmark Book That Will Take Its Place As The Defining Biography Of One Of America's Greatest Artists. It Begins In Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, Where, Raised By A Bandleader Father And Schoolteacher Mother, Simon Grew Up With The Twin Passions Of Baseball And Music. The Latter Took Over At Age Twelve When He And Schoolboy Chum Art Garfunkel Became Infatuated With The Alluring Harmonies Of Doo-wop. Together, They Became International Icons, And Then Simon Went On To Even Greater Artistic Heights On His Own. But Beneath The Surface Of His Storied Five-decade Career Is A Roller Coaster Of Tumultuous Personal And Professional Ups And Downs. From His Remarkable Early Success With Garfunkel To Their Painfully Acrimonious Split; From His Massive Early Hits As A Solo Artist To The Wrenching Commercial Failures Of One-trick Pony And Hearts And Bones; From The Historic Comeback Success Of Graceland And The Rhythm Of The Saints To The Star-crossed Foray Into Theater With The Capeman And A Late-career Creative Resurgence--his Is A Musical Life Unlike Any Other. Over The Past Three Years, Hilburn Has Conducted In-depth Interviews With Scores Of Paul Simon's Friends, Family, Colleagues, And Others--including Ex-wives Carrie Fisher And Peggy Harper, Who Spoke For The First Time--and Even Penetrated The Inner Circle Of Simon's Long-reclusive Muse, Kathy Chitty. The Result Is A Deeply Human Account Of The Challenges And Sacrifices Of A Life In Music At The Highest Level. In The Process, Hilburn Documents Simon's Search For Artistry And His Constant Struggle To Protect That Artistry Against Distractions--fame, Marriage, Divorce, Drugs, Record Company Interference, Rejection, And Insecurity--that Have Derailed So Many Great Pop Figures. Paul Simon Is An Intimate And Inspiring Narrative That Helps Us Finally Understand Paul Simon The Person And The Artist.-from Dust Jacket. For More Than Fifty Years Simon Has Spoken To Us In Songs About Alienation, Doubt, Resilience, And Empathy; But He Is A Deeply Private Person Who Resisted Speaking To Us Outside Of His Music. He Recently Opened Up To Hilburn, Who Has Also Conducted In-depth Interviews With Scores Of Simon's Friends, Family, And Colleagues. The Result Is A Deeply Human Account Of The Challenges And Sacrifices Of A Life In Music At The Highest Level.

In Fact, He Has Been Making Headlines For His Role In Investigating Murders That Occurred Over The Last Century. Various Newspapers And Magazines Have Even Dubbed Him A Forensic Historian. Simon Is Just Starting To Warm Up To This Title When Another Mystery Presents Itself.<p>a Forest Ranger Has Discovered The Remains Of A Young Woman Below The Blue Ridge Parkway In Boone, North Carolina. It's The Corpse Of Eva Potter, Who Had Disappeared In 1958. A Man She Was Dating, Roy Freedman, Confessed To Her Murder. Now Freedman, Serving A Life Term, Claims His Confession Was False And Wants Simon's Help In Dicovering The Real Killer. <p>although Simon Can't Decide Whether Or Not The Man Really Is Innocent, He Reluctantly Agrees. His Inquiries Take Him To Boone, The Mountain Town Where He Grew Up And Where Many Of His Relatives Still Live. Even If Nothing Comes Of The Trip, Simon Sees It As Opportunity To Get Away From The Unrelenting Heat Of Raleigh And His Current Quarrel With His Girlfriend Julia; Simon, Deep In His Research, Had Forgotten Their Date And Left Her Stranded On His Front Steps. It Will Also Give Him The Chance To Catch Up With His Aunts And Uncles And Cousins.<p>an Old Map Of Watauga County Leads Simon To Believe That The Key To The Solution Of Eva's Murder Is Hidden Near The Spot Where She Was Killed. When A Man Who Seemed To Have Some Long-hidden Information About The Woman's Disappearance Is Killed, Simon Realizes That There Is Someone In Boone Who Will Stop At Nothing To Keep Him From Learning The Truth.</p><h3>publishers Weekly</h3><p>in His Third Winning Cozy (simon Says; Snipe Hunt), History Professor Simon Shaw's Journey To The Homeplace In North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains Is Interrupted By An Escaped Convict, Roy Freedman, Who At Gunpoint Asks His Help In Finding Evidence To Support Freedman's Claim Of Innocence For A Murder Committed Decades Before. Once Home, The Obliging Prof Taps Into The Local Collective Memory, Gossiping With His Kin And Acquaintances At The Sheriff's Department. What He Finds Is Unsettling. Why Was So Little Evidence Recorded At The Time Of The Murder? What Motive Would Drive Freedman To Plead Guilty To A Crime He Didn't Commit And Serve 40 Years In Prison? Learning The Answers To These Questions May Prove More Dangerous Than Simon Bargained For. Shaber Excels At Depicting Local Color, From Appalachian Geology And Native Flora, To Evocative Glimpses Of Postwar Rural America. With His Migraines, Tenure Worries And Wounded Feelings After A Spat With His Girlfriend, The 30-something Simon Comes Across As Likable And All Too Human-we Understand Why His Relations Are Glad To See Him. Minor Characters Also Have Their Appealing Foibles, Especially Simon's Uncle And Aunt, Mel And Rae, Who Are Separated Because Mel Looks Forward To Retirement And Rae Would Die If She Stopped Working. A Chatty Style Is Perfectly Suited To An Investigation That Depends So Much On Conversation And Characters' Reminiscences.

Knopf, Inc., And Its Inimitable Logo Featuring A Borzoi Wolfhound Have Come To Signify The Pinnacle Of Prestigious Publishing. Launched In 1915 By A Dynamic Twenty-two-year-old And His Refined Fiancée, Blanche Wolf, The Firm Soon Developed A Reputation For Excellence, Quickly Overcoming Outsider Status To Forge A Unique Identity That Has Endured Well Past Its Founders' Lifetimes. Capturing The Little-known Early History Of Knopf, The Art Of Prestige Explores The Origins Of The Company's Rise To Success During The Jazz Age, When Alfred And Blanche Established Themselves As Literary Impresarios On Both Sides Of The Atlantic. Drawing On Key Archival Documents From All Phases Of The Publishing Process, Amy Root Clements Reconstructs The Turning Points And Rhetorical Exchanges That Made Knopf's Initial Books Noteworthy, From The Acquisitions Process To Design, Consumer Marketing, And Bookselling.
